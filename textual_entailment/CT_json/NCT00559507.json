Simon's two-stage optimal design was used to estimate the DCR of AZD0530 after 24 weeks of therapy since this design allowed for early termination of the study. Response and progression was evaluated in this study using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Target lesions: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started",
