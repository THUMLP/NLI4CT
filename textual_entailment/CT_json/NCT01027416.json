        "  Core biopsy should definitively demonstrate invasive carcinoma.",
        "  Invasive carcinoma should be ER-apha receptor positive",
        "  The tumor should be approximately at least 1 cm, to account for variability in imaging and imaging occult disease (physical exam, mammography, ultrasound). We recognize that from time to time because of this variation, there might not be enough tissue available for analysis after surgical excision but this will allow the greatest opportunity to capture as many eligible patients as possible.",
