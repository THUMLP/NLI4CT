        "  Clinical Response (Complete or Partial Response) Rate (Cohort A)",
        "  The clinical response rate (percentage) of a given treatment is defined as 100 times the number of eligible patients randomized to that treatment whose disease meets the WHO criteria for complete or partial response prior to surgery divided by the total number of eligible patients randomized to that treatment. For each treatment arm, a 95% binomial confidence interval will be constructed for the true clinical response rate. Complete Response (CR): The disappearance of all known disease based on a comparison between the measurements at baseline and the Week 16 visit. Partial Response (PR): A 50% or greater decrease in the product of the bi-dimensional measurements of the lesion (total tumor size) based on a comparison between the measurements at baseline and the Week 16 visit. In addition there can be no appearance of new lesions or progression of any lesion.",
