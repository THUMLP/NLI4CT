        "  Hot flash activity will be analyzed in a number of ways. For the primary analysis, the numerical change-from-baseline to hot flash score after week 6 of treatment will be compared between the highest dose treatment arm and the placebo arm. A hot flash score is computed for each patient by assigning points (1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=very severe) to each hot flash based on patient-reported severity, adding the points for each day, and averaging across each week of the study.
