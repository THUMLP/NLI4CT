        "  Complete pathological response: No invasive tumor cells identified from sections from site of previous cancer. Require evidence corroborating prior presence of invasive cancer, which requires detection of abnormal fibroelastic breast stroma devoid of normal lobular units and contains foamy macrophages with moderate numbers of fibroblasts and mononuclear inflammatory cells. Presence of nondescript collagenised lobules or breast fibrous tissue is not evidence that tumor site has been adequately sampled and macroscopic assessment and sampling is needed until original neoplastic stroma identified.",
