        "  Time to disease progression (TTP) in days was defined as the time from enrollment to objective disease progression (all categories other than objective disease progression was set to be censored including death before progression). Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a nontarget lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Tumor assessments were performed using computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. TTP as assessed by investigator, along with a recalculation done by computer algorithm is presented below. Median time was not assessed for 'Only Chemotherapy' group as randomization of participants was not feasible considering Trastuzumab widespread use in routine clinical practice.",
