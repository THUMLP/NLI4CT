        "  The percentage of participants with pCR was determined by anatomopathological study after completion of 8 cycles of study treatment. The anatomopathological study of the surgical piece was performed and assessed according to the Miller-Payne criteria: 1) the primary tumor was Grade 5 (no malignant cells identified at the location of the primary tumor (ductal carcinoma in situ may be present); 2) no involvement was identified in the lymph nodes; 3) the tumour size at evaluation of the surgical piece was 0 centimeters (cm); and 4) the pathological staging of the tumour from the surgical piece was pT0pN0pM0, the stage is not applicable (NA). It will only be considered pCR in the case of absence of invasive tumour cells in the breast and lymph nodes.",
