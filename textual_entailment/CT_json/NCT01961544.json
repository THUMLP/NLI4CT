        "  An AE is defined as any harmful, untoward sign (including abnormal laboratory value, etc.), symptom, or disease in a participant administered investigational product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE is defined as an AE that is life threatening or results in death, results in hospitalization (initial or prolonged), results in a disability (significant, persistent, or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the participant's body function/structure, physical activities, or quality of life), results in a congenital anomaly, or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. TEAEs are defined as those events that started on or after the date and time of administration of the first dose of study drug and those events that were present prior to the administration of the first dose of study drug and increased in severity during the study.",
