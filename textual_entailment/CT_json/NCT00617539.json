        "  Number of Patients With Objective Treatment Response (Complete or Partial) in the CNS",
        "  Imaging was performed at 8-week intervals to assess response to treatment. Patients with known or suspected leptomeningeal disease were deemed to have a complete response if CSF cytology converted to negative (if positive at baseline) and all meningeal enhancement or nodularity of brain and/or spine MRI resolved. A modified RECIST 1.0 criteria was used to assess CNS response for patients with new or progressing brain metastases. In this modified RECIST criteria, CNS lesions <1cm were not considered measurable, but were considered evaluable for response and progression. Progressive disease for patients with lesions <1 cm was defined as follows: growth of a lesion from less than or equal to 5 mm to greater than or equal to 10mm; or, growth of a 6-9 mm lesion by at least 5 mm in the case of non-target parenchymal brain metastases.",
