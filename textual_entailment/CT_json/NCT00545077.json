In the event that the patient only has locally advanced disease, she will not be able to undergo curative local treatment. Patients with metastasis confined to the bone can be chosen, but the disease must be confirmed by radiology, CT scan or Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) if there is any doubt after a single bone scan.",
