Participants were treated at each dose level (DL) for minimum of 21 days before accrual to the next DL. Rules for dose escalation: If 0 dose level toxicity (DLT) was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, the next higher cohort was opened to accrual. If 1 DLT was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, then 3 additional participants were studied. If 0 DLT was observed in those 3 (ie, 1 DLT in 6 subjects at the DL), the next higher cohort was opened for accrual. If >=2 DLT was observed in up to 6 subjects, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded and the next lower DL was defined as the MTD. If 0 DLT was observed in 6 participants in a cohort and the next higher DL exceeded the MTD, then intermediate DLs would be studied. Once the MTD was determined, additional participants were enrolled into that dose group.",

An adverse event (AE) was considered a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) if it occurred in the first 21 days and was at least possibly related to study drugs and were: Clinically-evident toxicity of Grade >= 3, or of Grade 2 which required interruption of treatment for >= 7 days (consecutive or non-consecutive); non-hematologic abnormal laboratory value of Grade >= 3, or hematologic toxicity of Grade 4, which persisted 7 days; any grade toxicity which in the judgment of the investigator required a dose reduction or removal from further study therapy.",
