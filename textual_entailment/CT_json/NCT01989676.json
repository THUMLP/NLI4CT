The first infusion of PF-05280014 was 4 mg/kg over 90 minutes on Cycle 1 Day 1. Subsequent weekly infusions of PF-05280014 were 2 mg/kg over 30 to 90 minutes.

Following completion of the paclitaxel administration period and beginning no earlier than Week 33 of the study, the PF-05280014 could be changed at the discretion of the investigator to every 3 weeks at a dose of 6 mg/kg infused over 30 to 90 minutes depending on tolerability.",
