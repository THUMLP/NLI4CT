Trastuzumab was administered throughout the course of the CT and for two weeks after the last CT administration. The first dose of trastuzumab was administered at 4 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) IV for 60 minutes on the day of the first paclitaxel course. Subsequent administrations were given weekly at 2 mg/kg IV for 30 minutes. Treatments were administered for 26 weeks prior to surgery.",

        "  Pathological Complete Response (pCR) is defined by the complete absence of infiltrating tumor cells in the breast and in the lymph nodes. The pathological response in the breast was evaluated according to the criteria of Miller and Payne as follows: Grade 1, no change or some alteration to individual malignant cells, but no reduction in overall cellularity; Grade 2, a minor loss in tumor cells (up to 30%); Grade 3, between an estimated 30% and 90% reduction in tumor cells; Grade 4, marked disappearance of tumor cells, with only a small cluster or a dispersed cell remaining (more than 90% loss); Grade 5, no identifiable malignant cells. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may be present. Grades were interpreted as follows: Grade 1-2=no response; Grade 3-4=partial response; Grade 5=complete response. pCR was defined by comparing specimens obtained at Baseline (biopsy) to those obtained upon surgery.",
