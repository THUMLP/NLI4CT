        "  Progression-Free Survival (PFS)",
        "  Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization until the first radiographically documented progression of disease or death from any cause, whichever occurred first (either during study treatment or during follow-up). Progression of disease was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1 and is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). The sum of target lesion diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). Participants with no PFS events were censored at the time of the last evaluable tumor assessment. The primary analysis of PFS was planned to be performed when a total of 165 PFS events had occurred, and the final analysis after at least 60 months follow-up.",
