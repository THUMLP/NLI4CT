        "  Response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria based on Cycle 2, Day 21 computed tomography (CT) scans. Response is categorized as complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions, confirmed at  4 weeks; partial response (PR):  30% decrease in target lesions from baseline, confirmed at  4 weeks; progressive disease (PD):  20% increase over smallest sum observed with an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or appearance of new lesions; and stable disease (SD): neither PR or PD criteria met.",
        "  A Simon two-stage design was planned in which an initial cohort of 21 patients was treated. If 2 or more responses (PR or CR) are seen at the first tumor re-evaluation on day 21 of Cycle 2, the study would be expanded to include up to 41 patients (20 additional patients in Cohort 2, the second stage of the study) in order to determine whether further development of the drug is warranted (5 or more responses in 41 evaluable patients).",
