        "  100 mg/m2 of intravenous (IV) nab paclitaxel weekly (i.e., on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 3 week treatment cycle) in combination with 600 mg/m2 of IV cyclophosphamide once every 3 weeks for 4 cycles (i.e., a total treatment period of 12 weeks [84 days]). Patients with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) HER2+ or IHC3+ breast cancer will also receive treatment with trastuzumab in addition to the nab paclitaxel / cyclophosphamide combination therapy. Maintenance therapy with trastuzumab will continue (for the HER2+ patients who are receiving trastuzumab) after the 12-week treatment period with combination nab paclitaxel/cyclophosphamide/trastuzumab. The total treatment time for trastuzumab will be 52 weeks rather than only 12 weeks."
