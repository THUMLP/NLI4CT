Patients who had contralateral breast cancer or a second primary malignancy, or died from some cause other than disease were censored as relapse-free at the time of death. Patients who had not relapsed were censored at longest follow-up or at non-breast cancer death. As required, adjudication was used to assess reports of recurrence.",
