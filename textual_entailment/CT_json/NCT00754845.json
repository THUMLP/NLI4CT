Subjects who died without recurrence of the primary disease or the development of the contralateral breast cancer were censored at their death date. If a patient has not recurred, developed a contralateral breast cancer, or died, disease-free survival was censored on the date of the last day the patient was known to be alive. Probability of disease free survival at 5 years is estimated and reported.",
