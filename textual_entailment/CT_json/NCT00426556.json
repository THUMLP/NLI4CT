        "  Phase II: Overall Response Rate",
        "  The primary objective of this phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy of the dose level/regimen of everolimus recommended from the Phase I with trastuzumab and paclitaxel (PT) therapy in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer whose disease progressed on/after trastuzumab mono-and/or combination therapy based on the evaluation of objective response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Only patients with measurable disease (the presence of at least one measurable lesion) at baseline were included in the study. CR = Disappearance of all target lesions; PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameters.",
