Primary surgery will then be conducted, if operable, following completion of neoadjuvant treatment. This will be followed by standard adjuvant AC (doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, every 3 weeks) for 4 cycles. For patients whose BSA is greater than 2.0 m2, the Adriamycin dosage will be calculated using BSA = 2.0 m2. This is done in order to minimize Adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity.",
