Pathological response was assessed after surgery, according to the Miller & Payne criteria, which stratifies the responses based on the proportion of remaining tumor and post-chemotherapy changes, evaluating separately the response in breast and axilla. Grades 1-4 are categorised as a partial pathological response (pPR) and grade 5 was a complete pathological response (cPR).",
