If patients have undergone CyberKnife treatment, treatment must be completed  14 days prior to registration.",
        "  Patients may have received prior oral bisphosphonate therapy, such as Fosamax\u00ae or similar medications. Duration of bisphosphonate treatment prior to study entry must be documented, and all bisphosphonates other than the study drug must be discontinued prior to registration.",

        "  6.4 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Center for Disease Control (CDC) definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive. Protocol-specific requirements may also exclude immuno-compromised patients.",
