        "  Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be used. A 95% confidence interval for the median PFS will be calculated. A lower bound greater than 8 months would be strong evidence that Nab-Paclitaxel- bevacizumab induction therapy followed by bevacizumab-erlotinib hydrochloride maintenance therapy is superior to paclitaxel and bevacizumab. However, a median PFS of 13 months or greater (regardless of whether the 95% confidence interval for the median extends below 8 months) could also indicate promising results.",
