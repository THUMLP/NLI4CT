This phase 1 study used a 3+3 design with 7 indoximod dose levels (DL) (100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg daily (QD) then 800 mg, 1,200 mg, and 1,600 mg PO BID +up to 6 fixed dose Ad.p53 DC vaccinations q2wks. Toxicity was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0. The MTD is the highest dose level below the maximally administered dose (MAD) that is safely tolerated among 6 treated patients, that is, 0 or 1 out of 6 patients experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT).",
