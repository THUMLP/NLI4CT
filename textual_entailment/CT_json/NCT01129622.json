The signal intensity of enhancement was recorded and the relative enhancement (percentage of increase in signal intensity) was calculated as (SIc - SI)/SI \u00d7 100, where SI and SIc are the precontrast and the postcontrast signal intensities, respectively. Relative enhancement was compared at the baseline MRI study and the after one month MRI study for all participants.",
