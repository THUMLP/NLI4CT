        "  TTPD is defined as the time from the day of treatment to first observation of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first. TTPD was censored at the time of last follow-up for patients who were still alive without progression. Tumor response was assessed in cancer patients by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), which define when cancer patients improve (\"respond\"), stay the same (\"stabilize\"), or worsen (\"progression\") during treatments. Progressive Disease is a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions.",
