        "  At least one radiographically confirmed metastatic bone lesion",
        "  No change of cancer therapy for at least 8 weeks before randomization",
        "Exclusion Criteria:",
        "  Have had any prior exposure to bisphosphonate",
        "  Have had hip fractures or bilateral hip prothesis fracture of any kind or surgery to bone within the past 12 months",
        "  Inadequate renal function or low haemoglobin",
        "  Inadequate liver function as demonstrated by serum bilirubin 2 times the upper limits of reference range (ULRR) or by alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase(AST) or ALP 2.5 times the ULRR (  5 times the ULRR in the presence of liver metastases). If bone metastases are present and liver function is otherwise considered adequate by the investigator then elevated ALP will not exclude the patient."
