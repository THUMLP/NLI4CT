Reported the number of readers meeting the Pass Criteria on the final FFDM plus DBT assessment case set, which requires adequate performance in cancer cases (detection rate) as well as non-cancer cases (recall rate). Per-subject BI-RADS, POM and recall scores were derived. Credit was only given for identifying a subject with cancer if the reader marked findings in at least one location with cancer. Findings that did not match the location of a malignant lesion were ignored for cancer cases in the per-subject analyses.",
