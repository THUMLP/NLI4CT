At MDACC, the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) for determining Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) was applied to the two predefined RAD001 dose levels; and at DFCI/BIDMC, a 3 x 3 study design was utilized.",

Participants underwent clinical evaluation every 3 weeks (one cycle) and radiologic evaluations every 6 weeks. After the second cycle, participants underwent a radiologic evaluation using the same imaging technique used at initial evaluation (ie, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging).",
