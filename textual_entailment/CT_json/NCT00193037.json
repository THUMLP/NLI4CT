Complete Response is the total disappearance of clinically and radiologically detectable disease for at least 4 weeks. Partial Response is at least a 50% reduction of all measurable lesions as measured by the product of the perpendicular diameters of the greatest dimensions of tumor size, with no new lesions appearing for at least four weeks.",
