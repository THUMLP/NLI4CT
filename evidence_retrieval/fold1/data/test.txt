Progression of disease was determined if at least 1 of the following criteria applied:	At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters (SoD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest SoD recorded since the treatment started, together with an absolute increase in the SoD of at least 5 mm	Appearance of 1 or more new lesions	Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions	Time frame: From randomization (07Sep2010) until disease progression, death or data cut-off (08Jun2013); Up to 34 months	Results 1:	Arm/Group Title: Afatinib + Vinorelbine (AV)	Arm/Group Description: Participants received oral treatment of film-coated Afatinib tablet at a starting dose of 40 milligram (mg) once daily and weekly 10 minutes intravenous infusion of Vinorelbine 25 mg/meter^2 (meter=m) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each course. The treatment was administered in treatment courses of 28 days. For Afatinib, a protocol-defined dose-reduction scheme was to be followed if a participant experienced certain pre-specified adverse events. From 26 April 2013, any participant who had been randomised to the AV arm stopped treatment, had the option to switch to Trastuzamb + Vinorelbine.

Clinical Management: Clinical management is a clear contrast method of psychological therapy, which is a half-structured interview and lasting for 20-25 minutes each session. Clinical management will be assigned to both experimental group and controlled group in the first stage of intervention.	Following are major elements:	Talk to the subjects to find their main problems; introduce knowledge and medication knowledge about cancer and depression; subjects reporting use of drugs for cancer and depression and a variety of signs and symptoms of the reaction. Encourage patients to adhere to drug treatment and to comply with this research program; The operation of CBT and clinical management should be conducted by the same person as far as possible.	INTERVENTION 2:	Stage 1 CBT	The experimental group will receive CBT each session.	CBT and clinical management: The subjects will receive standardized CBT treatment regularly for 9 sessions(once per week in the first month and once half a month in the second and third months), and each session will last for about 60 minutes.The treatment includes three steps:Concept stage (the first and second sessions): establishment of therapeutic relationships with the subjects; Skills acquisition and repeat stage (the third session to the 8th session): clarification of sources of stress, patients' cognitive and behavioral response to stress.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Progression Free Survival (PFS)	PFS was assessed by the investigator based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria using radiographic tumor evaluations. Disease progression was defined as the appearance of any new lesion not previously identified or an estimated increase of 25% or more in existent bidimensionally or unidimensionally measurable lesions or progression of an existing non-measurable lesion. For bidimensionally measurable malignant lesions with an area of at least 2.0 centimeters squared (cm^2) an increase of 1.0 cm^2 was required and for unidimensionally measurable lesions of 1.0 cm or less an increase of 0.5 cm was required. PFS was defined as the number of days between date of randomization and date of documented disease progression or date of death. Kaplan Meier estimates of PFS are presented.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Progression-free Survival (PFS)	Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be used. A 95% confidence interval for the median PFS will be calculated. A lower bound greater than 8 months would be strong evidence that Nab-Paclitaxel- bevacizumab induction therapy followed by bevacizumab-erlotinib hydrochloride maintenance therapy is superior to paclitaxel and bevacizumab. However, a median PFS of 13 months or greater (regardless of whether the 95% confidence interval for the median extends below 8 months) could also indicate promising results.

secondary trial Outcome Measurement:	Number of Patients With Objective Treatment Response (Complete or Partial) in the CNS	Imaging was performed at 8-week intervals to assess response to treatment. Patients with known or suspected leptomeningeal disease were deemed to have a complete response if CSF cytology converted to negative (if positive at baseline) and all meningeal enhancement or nodularity of brain and/or spine MRI resolved. A modified RECIST 1.0 criteria was used to assess CNS response for patients with new or progressing brain metastases. In this modified RECIST criteria, CNS lesions <1cm were not considered measurable, but were considered evaluable for response and progression. Progressive disease for patients with lesions <1 cm was defined as follows: growth of a lesion from less than or equal to 5 mm to greater than or equal to 10mm; or, growth of a 6-9 mm lesion by at least 5 mm in the case of non-target parenchymal brain metastases.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Percentage of Participants With Feasibility	The regimen was considered feasible if the participant was able to complete the eribulin portion without dose delay or reduction. Dose delay was defined as a delay due to eribulin-related adverse event (AE) for more than 2 days for subsequent doses (cycles after the initiation of full dose of eribulin, except holidays, scheduling difficulties and nonclinical logistical issues). If a participant had more than 1 dose omission, delay or reduction due to eribulin-related AE, these events were collectively counted as one entity in the same participant. Participants were followed for approximately 3 years after the last dose of the study treatment. Feasibility rates were calculated with or without growth factor support. In both cohorts, the percentage of participants who completed the eribulin portion of the regimen without a dose omission, delay or reduction due to eribulin-related AE was estimated via the observed completion rate and an exact 90% confidence interval (CI) was constructed.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Percentage of Participants With Feasibility	The regimen was considered feasible if the participant was able to complete the eribulin portion without dose delay or reduction. Dose delay was defined as a delay due to eribulin-related adverse event (AE) for more than 2 days for subsequent doses (cycles after the initiation of full dose of eribulin, except holidays, scheduling difficulties and nonclinical logistical issues). If a participant had more than 1 dose omission, delay or reduction due to eribulin-related AE, these events were collectively counted as one entity in the same participant. Participants were followed for approximately 3 years after the last dose of the study treatment. Feasibility rates were calculated with or without growth factor support. In both cohorts, the percentage of participants who completed the eribulin portion of the regimen without a dose omission, delay or reduction due to eribulin-related AE was estimated via the observed completion rate and an exact 90% confidence interval (CI) was constructed.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Number of Participants With Complete Pathologic Response.	Pathologic complete response (pCR): Absence of invasive breast cancer in the breast (mastectomy or lumpectomy) specimen at the time of definitive surgery. Presence of in situ cancer alone will be considered a pCR.	Although clinical examination is the primary method of determining response, radiologic assessments (mammogram, ultrasound ± MRI) may be used to confirm response/non-response.	Time frame: assess at 8 weeks	Results 1:	Arm/Group Title: Trastuzumab and Abraxane Followed Trastuzumab and Vinorelbine	Arm/Group Description: Patients will be treated sequentially with preoperative trastuzumab and dose-dense ABI-007 followed by trastuzumab in combination with vinorelbine. Trastuzumab will be administered as a one-time loading dose of 4 mg/kg as a 90 minute infusion, followed by 20 weekly treatments at 2 mg/kg as a 30 minute infusion. ABI-007 will be administered every 2 weeks at a dose of 260mg/m2 as 30 minute infusion on the same days as trastuzumab for a total of 4 cycles (weeks 1 -8). Growth factor support with pegfilgrastim (Neulasta  ) is required 24 to 48 hours following completion of each cycle of ABI-007. Beginning week 9, patients will then receive weekly vinorelbine at a dose of 25mg/m2 for 12 weeks on the same day as trastuzumab for a total of 4 cycles (weeks 9-20).
