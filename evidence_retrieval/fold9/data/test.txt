Participants were treated at each dose level (DL) for minimum of 21 days before accrual to the next DL. Rules for dose escalation: If 0 dose level toxicity (DLT) was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, the next higher cohort was opened to accrual. If 1 DLT was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, then 3 additional participants were studied. If 0 DLT was observed in those 3 (ie, 1 DLT in 6 subjects at the DL), the next higher cohort was opened for accrual. If >=2 DLT was observed in up to 6 subjects, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded and the next lower DL was defined as the MTD. If 0 DLT was observed in 6 participants in a cohort and the next higher DL exceeded the MTD, then intermediate DLs would be studied.

Patients must have clinical Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] staging criteria) with a primary breast tumor that is greater than/equal to 2.0 cm measured by clinical exam, unless the patient has inflammatory breast carcinoma, in which case measurable disease is not required.	Patients must have the ability to swallow oral medication.	The patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be 0 or 1.	At the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria:	Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.	Platelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm^3.	Hemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.

Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.	Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or positron emission tomography (PET) scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or biopsy.	Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (computed tomography [CT], MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease and adequate hepatic function.	The following criteria for evidence of adequate renal function must be met:	Serum creatinine less than/equal to ULN for the lab.	Calculated creatinine clearance must be greater than 50 mL/min.	Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0.

The LVEF must be greater than/equal to the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the cardiac imaging facility performing the MUGA scan or echocardiogram. Note: If the cardiac imaging facility cannot provide a LLN, use 50% as the LLN value.	Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if bevacizumab therapy can be continued following doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) and postoperatively, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the MUGA scan or echocardiogram must be repeated prior to study entry. The lower of the two LVEF values should be used as the baseline LVEF.	Patients must have an electrocardiogram (EKG) within 3 months prior to study entry.

Participants were treated at each dose level (DL) for minimum of 21 days before accrual to the next DL. Rules for dose escalation: If 0 dose level toxicity (DLT) was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, the next higher cohort was opened to accrual. If 1 DLT was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, then 3 additional participants were studied. If 0 DLT was observed in those 3 (ie, 1 DLT in 6 subjects at the DL), the next higher cohort was opened for accrual. If >=2 DLT was observed in up to 6 subjects, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded and the next lower DL was defined as the MTD. If 0 DLT was observed in 6 participants in a cohort and the next higher DL exceeded the MTD, then intermediate DLs would be studied. Once the MTD was determined, additional participants were enrolled into that dose group.

primary trial Inclusion Criteria:	Patients must be female.	The patient must be greater than/equal to 18 years old	The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy or limited incisional biopsy.	Patients must have clinical Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] staging criteria) with a primary breast tumor that is greater than/equal to 2.0 cm measured by clinical exam, unless the patient has inflammatory breast carcinoma, in which case measurable disease is not required.	Patients must have the ability to swallow oral medication.	The patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be 0 or 1.	At the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria:	Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.	Platelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm^3.	Hemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.	The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:	total bilirubin must be less than/equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and	alkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and	aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.	Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.	Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or positron emission tomography (PET) scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or biopsy.	Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (computed tomography [CT], MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease and adequate hepatic function.	The following criteria for evidence of adequate renal function must be met:	Serum creatinine less than/equal to ULN for the lab.	Calculated creatinine clearance must be greater than 50 mL/min.	Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0.

The LVEF must be greater than/equal to the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the cardiac imaging facility performing the MUGA scan or echocardiogram. Note: If the cardiac imaging facility cannot provide a LLN, use 50% as the LLN value.	Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if bevacizumab therapy can be continued following doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) and postoperatively, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the MUGA scan or echocardiogram must be repeated prior to study entry. The lower of the two LVEF values should be used as the baseline LVEF.	Patients must have an electrocardiogram (EKG) within 3 months prior to study entry.	Exclusion Criteria:	Tumor determined to be strongly HER2-positive by immunohistochemistry (3+) or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (positive for gene amplification).

In such a case, hormonal therapy must stop at or before study entry and be re-started, if indicated, following chemotherapy.	Any of the following cardiac conditions:	angina pectoris that requires the use of anti-anginal medication;	history of documented congestive heart failure;	serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication;	severe conduction abnormality;	valvular disease with documented cardiac function compromise; or	uncontrolled hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 150/90 on antihypertensive therapy. (Patients with hypertension that is well controlled on medication are eligible.)	History of myocardial infarction documented by elevated cardiac enzymes or persistent regional wall abnormalities on assessment of left ventricular (LV) function.	History of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA).	History of other arterial thrombotic event within 12 months before study entry.	Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease.

Patients are eligible only if these medications are discontinued prior to study entry.	Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to study entry. (Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during study therapy and for at least 3 months after completion of bevacizumab.)

primary trial INTERVENTION 1:	Decongestive Physiotherapy	This group received Complex Decongestive Physiotherapy.	Decongestive Physiotherapy: This group received CDP, which include MLD, short-stretch bandages, lymph-reducing exercises, and skin care. MLD was applied to the anterior trunk, posterior trunk, and the base of the neck, progressing to the affected limb. Short-stretch bandages were applied in multiple layers after MLD. A low pH skin lotion was applied prior to bandaging and then stockinette was placed on the arm. The fingers and the hand were wrapped in gauze. A layer of cotton was wrapped around the arm. Bandages (6, 8 and/or 10cm) were sequentially applied in a spiral fashion around the limb with the smallest bandage starting at the hand. The most compression was at the most distal points and gradually decreased proximally. Exercises were done by patients to improve mobility and enhance lymphatic flow.	INTERVENTION 2:	Decongestive Physiotherapy Plus Taping	This group received Complex Decongestive Physiotherapy, and also applying taping to anastomosis regions.	Decongestive Physiotherapy plus taping: This group received CDP as same protocol of active comparator. In addition, taping was applied to anterior and posterior axillo-axillary anastomosis and axillo-inguinal anastomosis. The tape was started on the unaffected side and strips of tape were applied so as to reach the affected side regarding anterior and posterior axillo-axillary anastomosis. For axillo-inguinal anastomosis, the tape was started in the inguinal region of the affected side and strips of tape were applied so that they reached the axillary region.	Participants in group 2 of the primary trial receive taping to anastomosis regions., but no  Complex Decongestive Physiotherapy.	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (All Causalities)	An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment. All AEs reported after initiation of study drug treatment were considered as treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). AE severity was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) version 4.03. Grade 1 AEs are mild AEs; Grade 2 AEs are moderate AEs; Grade 3 AEs are severe AEs, Grade 4 AEs are life-threatening consequences and Grade 5 AEs are deaths related to AEs. Each AE was counted once for the participant in the most severe severity. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.
