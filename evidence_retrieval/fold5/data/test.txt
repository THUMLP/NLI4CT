Following are major elements:	Talk to the subjects to find their main problems; introduce knowledge and medication knowledge about cancer and depression; subjects reporting use of drugs for cancer and depression and a variety of signs and symptoms of the reaction. Encourage patients to adhere to drug treatment and to comply with this research program; The operation of CBT and clinical management should be conducted by the same person as far as possible.	INTERVENTION 2:	Stage 1 CBT	The experimental group will receive CBT each session.
