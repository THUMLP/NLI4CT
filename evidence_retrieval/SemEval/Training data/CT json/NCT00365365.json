        "  Complete staging work-up as follows: All subjects must have an appropriate radiographic evaluation, e.g., computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, and/or (magnetic resonance imaging) MRI of the brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis, and imaging of bone by either a bone scan or PET scan. In cases of positive bone imaging, a bone X-ray or MRI evaluation is mandatory to rule out the possibility of metastatic bone scan disease. Other tests may be performed as clinically indicated. It is recommended that all baseline staging should be completed within 35 days prior to study entry.",

        "  Current therapy with any hormonal agent such as raloxifene, tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), either for osteoporosis or prevention of breast cancer. Subjects must have discontinued these agents prior to study entry.",

Chemotherapy may be given without bevacizumab in circumstances in which the participant has recovered sufficiently to receive chemotherapy but has not yet reached a 28 day time point at which bevacizumab could be administered."

        "  Participants were evaluated for clinical CHF every 3 weeks during chemotherapy, every 3 months while on maintenance therapy, and every 3 months during the 2-year follow-up period. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of CHF was assessed by multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) or echocardiogram (ECHO) performed midway through completion of chemotherapy according to a treatment-specific schedule, every 12 weeks during maintenance therapy, and at 6 and 24 months after completion of maintenance therapy.",

The preferred terms (PT) cardiac failure congestive, cardiomyopathy, and ejection fraction decreased were associated with CHF.",
