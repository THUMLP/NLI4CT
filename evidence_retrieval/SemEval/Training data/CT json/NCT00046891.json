HSCS instrument contains questions regarding Memory (0-39), Language (0-30), Visual-motor (0-10), Spatial (0-8), Attention and Concentration (0-25), Self-Regulation and Planning (0-6) on a varying scales. Total is calculated by summing afore mentioned subscales, values of Total ranged from 0 to 125. Lower scores are better.",
