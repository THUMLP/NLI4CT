        "  Microscopic pCR: No evidence of microscopic invasive tumor at the primary site or in the regional lymph nodes at the time of definitive surgical resection. mCR: The examining pathologist cannot identify gross residual tumor mass in the surgical specimen. This differs from a pCR where the specimen must also be negative for invasive tumor by microscopy. For this study, we are using a definition of mCR that will make the trial more translatable to other institutions. For this study, mCR will be defined as no focus of invasive cancer >= 1 cm.",
