        "  Vorinostat dose (200 or 300 mg BID) was assigned at the time of registration. Vorinostat was administered orally twice daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 of each 28-day cycle.",
        "  All patients also received paclitaxel at 90 mg/m2 as 1-hour infusion on days 2, 9, and 16 of every 28-day cycle. Bevacizumab was administered on day 2 and day 16 of the 28 day cycle at 10 mg/kg dose. Vorinostat dose escalation was carried out in the standard 3 + 3 phase I trial design based upon toxicity observed during the first cycle of therapy."

Any toxicity occurring during cycle 1 that resulted in dose reduction of vorinostat or paclitaxel or failure to complete all protocol specificed doses in the first cycle was also considered a DLT",
