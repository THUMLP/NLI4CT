        "Inclusion Criteria:",
        "  Patient must be scheduled to undergo either a single or bilateral elective nipple-areola skin sparing mastectomy (NASSM) procedure with planned immediate reconstruction.",
        "  Patient must be 18 years of age or older.",
        "  Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 80%.",
        "  Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document.",
        "Exclusion Criteria:",
        "  Cognitive impairment.",
        "  BMI < 18 or > 35",
        "  Breast >800 grams or <100 grams in predicted weight. \"Breast\" includes the breast tissue and in cases where the patient already has cosmetic breast implants, the additional breast implant mass. The sum total must be >100 g and <800 g.",
        "  History of radiation to the chest wall or breast being studied",
        "  Patients who have a history of allergy to iodides or iodinated contrast agents",
        "  Surgeon's opinion at the time of surgery that the subject's well-being would be compromised (e.g. significant comorbidities, intraoperative findings of a higher stage cancer or other independent acute health problems). If the contralateral breast is undergoing a nipple-sparing mastectomy with reconstruction as well, then the contralateral breast can be studied so long as there is no compromise to any element of their care."

        "  Laser-assisted fluorescent angiography via the Spy Elite imaging device will be utilized to capture this data during mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction. Standard postoperative patient follow up will assess for perfusion.",
        "  The Spy device quantifies perfusion by measuring relative fluorescence of indocyanine green bound to plasma proteins. This produces an intensity value of 0-255 based on an 8-bit greyscale. The investigators measured this value preoperatively when measured and compared to the post-intervention measurement. The device can calculate the cumulative intensity of a defined region of interest which the investigators categorized as the lateral, lower, medial, or nipple-areola region of the breast. The investigators also evaluated the cumulative value of these areas in total. Rate of perfusion was simply this value over time (90 seconds).",
