        "  Hemoglobin greater than 8.0 g/dl.",
        "  Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than two times the upper limit of normal.",
        "  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/dl.",
        "  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.6 mg/dl, except for patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl.",
        "  More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior therapy at the time the patient receives the preparative regimen.",

        "  Seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can have decreased immune competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)",

        "  Clinical Response",
        "  Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all clinical evidence of disease. Partial response (PR) is a 50% or greater decrease in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions for at least one month. No new lesions may appear, and none may increase. Minor response (MR) is a 25-49% decrease in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions. Appearance of new lesions following a PR or CR are considered relapses. Patients with progressive disease (PD) and no evidence of stable disease will be taken off study after receiving IL-2.",
