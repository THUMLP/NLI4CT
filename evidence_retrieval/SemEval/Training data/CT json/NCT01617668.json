        "Outcome Measurement: ",
        "  Pathological Complete Response (pCR) Rate in Breast After 12 Weeks of Therapy",
        "  pCR rate was defined as histopathologically confirmed absence of invasive disease in the breast. To assess whether adding LCL161 to weekly paclitaxel enhances the efficacy of paclitaxel in women with triple negative breast cancer. Analyses were performed separately in the gene expression signature negative and positive groups. This analysis was based on Bayesian design using a binomial distribution for the data with a beta prior. The measurement type used for this analysis is posterior median and the method of dispersion is Credible Interval (Crl) and not Confidence Interval (CI). Median values are posterior medians of pCR rate for each group.",
