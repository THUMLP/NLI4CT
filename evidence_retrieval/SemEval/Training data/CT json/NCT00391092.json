Progressive disease is defined using RECIST v1.0 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started. Primary PFS variable was defined based on the investigators' assessments and the statistical conclusions on the primary efficacy endpoint were based on investigator assessed PFS. PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.",
