        "  Six-month Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate at 6 Months",
        "  The primary endpoint of this trial is the 6-month progression-free survival rate. A patient is considered to be a 6-month progression-free survivor if the patient is on study treatment 6 months from registration without a documentation of disease progression. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Additionally, if some patients are lost to follow-up not having been observed for at least 6 months, an estimate and 95% confidence interval for the 6-month progression-free survival rate incorporating censoring will be computed using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.",
