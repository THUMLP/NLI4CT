        "  Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) must have exhibited a reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study accompanied by an absolute increase of at least 5 mm or appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference smallest sum diameters. PFS is time from enrollment to date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause. A participant is considered to be censored when data on time to event is missing due to a subject being lost to follow-up or non-occurrence of the outcome event before the completion of the trial.",
