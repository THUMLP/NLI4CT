        "  Opioid-tolerant. Subjects who were opioid tolerant were those taking  60 mg of oral morphine/day, at least 25 \u03bcg of transdermal fentanyl/hour, at least 30 mg of oxycodone daily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week or longer for cancer-related pain.",
        "  Experienced persistent pain related to the cancer or its treatment of moderate or lesser intensity in the 24 hours prior to assessment by a verbal rating scale at the Screening Visit.",
        "  Over the previous 7 days, subject experienced, on average, 1 to 4 breakthrough cancer pain episodes per day usually at least partially controlled by supplemental medication of at least 5 mg immediate-release morphine or an equivalent short-acting opioid (eg, oxycodone, hydrocodone, or codeine with acetaminophen).",
        "  Able to evaluate and record pain relief, assess medication performance at set times after dosing, record AEs, record each use of the study drug or supplemental medication in an electronic diary (a caregiver may have provided the subject the medication, help with the mechanics of handling the electronic diary but was not permitted to record any information in the electronic diary).",

        "  Intolerance to opioids or fentanyl.",
        "  Current use of commercially available oral short-acting fentanyl for breakthrough pain. Subjects previously on Actiq or Fentora were permitted to be enrolled if they had a 7 day washout.",
        "  Rapidly increasing/uncontrolled pain.",
        "  A history of major organ system impairment or disease, that in the Investigator's or his/her designee's opinion could increase the risk associated with the use of opioids.",
        "  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure {SBP} > 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] > 90 mmHg on 2 occasions  6 hours apart) despite antihypertensive therapy, or a history of hypertensive crisis within the past 2 years.",
        "  A recent history ( 2 years prior) of transient ischemic attacks, neural vascular disease, stroke, or cerebral aneurysms.",

        "Outcome Measurement: ",
        "  Summed Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) at 30 Minutes After Dosing (SPID30)",
        "  Pain intensity was assessed by the participant using a 0-100 mm visual analog scale where 0 represented \"no pain\" and 100 represented \"worst possible pain\" at 0 (baseline, beginning of the pain episode), 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after each dose of study medication during each breakthrough pain episode. The pain intensity difference was defined as the difference in pain intensity at the various time points versus time 0 (baseline). SPID30 was calculated as the time-weighted sum of the PID scores using the following formula: SPID30=(5*PID5)+(5*PID10)+(5*PID15)+(15*PID30). The minimum and maximum SPID30 scores were -3000 and 3000. A higher score indicates less pain.",
