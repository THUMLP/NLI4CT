The number of participants who experienced cognitive deterioration by 3 months is reported for each arm below. For primary analysis of the 3-month cognitive deterioration endpoint, the Fisher exact 2-group binomial test was used to compare the proportion of evaluable patients with 3-month cognitive deterioration between the 2 groups.",
