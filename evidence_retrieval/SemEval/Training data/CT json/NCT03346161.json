        "  Arm 1: BREASTChoice (Decision Tool)",
        "  Investigators recruited patients scheduled for a plastic/reconstruction consult. Investigators identified patients who completed a mastectomy, or were scheduled for one, and considering reconstruction, but didn't have an appointment with a plastic/reconstructive surgeon. A study team member called the patient to determine their interest and offered for them to come to their scheduled appointment 30 minutes early to meet a coordinator or offered them the option to complete pre-appointment procedures at home. Patients randomized using computer random assignment. If the patient didn't have an appointment, she scheduled a convenient time to complete study procedures with research staff. Patients interacted with the decision tool. They were asked to answer a survey. After the appointment, the team collected information consult duration, decision process quality, and measures of shared decision making. Patient participation was approximately 30 minutes.",
