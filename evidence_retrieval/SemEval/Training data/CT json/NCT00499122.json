        "  Rate of Pathologic Complete Response in the Affected Breast After Protocol Therapy",
        "  The primary objective of this study is to define the rate of pathologic complete response rate (pCR) in the affected breast after the preoperative administration of NOV-002 in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel in patients with stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer. Pathologic complete response (pCR) is defined according to Hankoop et al [41] as either: the absence of any histological evidence of invasive breast cancer cells in the tissue specimen removed from the breast or the presence of invasive tumor equal to or less than 10mm after preoperative treatment, determined at definitive breast surgery.",
