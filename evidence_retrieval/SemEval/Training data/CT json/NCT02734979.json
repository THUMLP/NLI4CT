        "  The investigators will investigate whether addition of the Biobridge scaffold to the standard surgery for vascularized lymph node transfer will improve the outcome of surgical treatment in lymphedema of the upper arm. The investigators will perform lymph scans (lymphoscintigrams) before surgery and one year following surgery to determine the success of the surgery. In addition, the volume of the operated arm will be monitored by repeated measurement with a tape measure. The investigators will also track bioimpedance, a painless technique to detect fluid in the tissues. The investigators will obtain small skin biopsies and blood samples to detect the biological changes that may occur as a result of successful surgery.",
