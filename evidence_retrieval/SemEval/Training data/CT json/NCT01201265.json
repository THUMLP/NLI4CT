        "  Progression free survival (PFS) was calculated in days from the date of registration until the earliest date of documented disease progression or death. The median PFS time with 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated using Kaplan Meier method. The progression-free survival was assessed utilizing computer tomography (CT)/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/bone scans and X-ray and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v. 1.1. Progression of disease is defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to the smallest sum of diameters on-study and absolute increase of at least 5 mm, progression of existing non-target lesions, or presence of new lesions.",
