In Part 1 of the study, participants received standard first-line therapy with trastuzumab and, at the discretion of treating clinician, either paclitaxel or docetaxel. Paclitaxel and docetaxel were administered according to one of following regimens: docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 or 100 mg/m^2 3-weekly (if docetaxel-na\u00efve) or docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 3-weekly (if prior adjuvant docetaxel) or docetaxel 60 mg/m^2 3-weekly (if liver dysfunction due to metastatic involvement) or paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 weekly or 175 mg/m^2 3-weekly until first disease progression. in Part II of the study, participants received capecitabine twice-daily 1000 mg/m^2 or higher, calculated based on BSA on days 1 to 14 while continuing trastuzumab treatment per standard practice until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity or participant request for discontinuation.",
