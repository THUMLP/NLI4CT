        "  The effects of EF5 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation (1 month). Should a woman become pregnant pr suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
