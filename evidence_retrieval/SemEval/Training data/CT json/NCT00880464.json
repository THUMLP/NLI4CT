        "  Minimum Number of Vaccine Doses Created Using Participant Tumor Sample",
        "  Tumor samples were obtained via malignant effusion or a surgically accessible tumor nodule of 2 cm in greatest diameter. Tumor cells were processed to single cell suspension and transduced with adenoviral vector encoding human Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Then, the cells washed extensively and irradiated with 10,000 cGy. Over the next 14 days, sterility cultures were tested for endotoxin and mycoplasma contamination. Individual vaccine cell dose and number varied depending on the final cell yield from vaccine production. For stage II-III patients, the minimal dose was 1 x 10^5 cells and the maximal dose was 4 x 10^6 cells. For metastatic patients, the minimal dose was 1 x 10^5 cells and the maximal dose was 1 x 10^7 cells.",
