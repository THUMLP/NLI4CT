        "  Progression-free Survival",
        "  Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of new lesions, or death (by any cause in the absence of progression). The primary analysis for PFS was the log rank test stratified by last endocrine therapy received prior to fulvestrant (AO vs. AI). The treatment effect was estimated using the HR of 500 mg fulvestrant to 250 mg fulvestrant together with the corresponding 95% CI and p value.",
