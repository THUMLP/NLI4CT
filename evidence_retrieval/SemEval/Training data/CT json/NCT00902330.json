        "  Effects of CES as Compared to Sham CES on Symptoms of Depression, Anxiety, Fatigue, Pain and Sleep Disturbances in Women Receiving Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Early-stage Breast Cancer",
        "  Using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) a 14 item scale, 7 relate to anxiety, 7 to depression; each item is scored from 0-3, a person can score 0 to 21 for either anxiety or depression (0 is best and 21 is worst), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short-form measures the intensity and interference of pain in the patient's life; 12 questions with 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes); mean will be used as the measure of pain; Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) assess the severity and impact of cancer-related fatigue. Has 9 questions with 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes), the total mean score is the mean of the 9 questions; severe fatigue can be defined as a score of 7 or higher, General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS) 21 items to evaluate sleep issues (0=never to 7=every day); the 21 items are summed to produce a total score of 9=no sleep disturbance to 137=extreme sleep disturbance .
