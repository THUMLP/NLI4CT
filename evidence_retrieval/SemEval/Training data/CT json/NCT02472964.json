Bisphosphonates/denosumab can be given simultaneously with study treatment but cannot start after randomization and is considered an indication of progressive disease (PD). Hormonal agents must be discontinued prior to beginning study therapy.",

        "  Patients with bone or skin as the only site of disease. Patients with skin lesions measurable by CT scans or MRI as only site of measurable disease are allowed.",
