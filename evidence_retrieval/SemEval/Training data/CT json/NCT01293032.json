        "Inclusion Criteria:",
        "  The treating surgeon must determine that breast conservation therapy (BCT) would be made more feasible by reducing tumor size using neoadjuvant systemic therapy",

        "  The patient must be female",
        "  The patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old",
        "  The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Score (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1",

        "  The primary breast tumor must be >= 2 cm by physical exam or imaging",
        "  Ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes must be evaluated by imaging (MRI or ultrasound) within 6 weeks prior to randomization; If indicated for abnormal lymph nodes, fine needle aspirate (FNA) or core biopsy must be performed.",
        "  The tumor must have been determined to be HER2-negative as follows:",
        "  Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)-negative (defined by ratio of HER2 to Chromosome 17 centromere (CEP17) must be < 2.2) or, if a ratio was not performed, the HER2 gene copy number must be < 4 per nucleus; or",
        "  Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) is performed, the result must indicate a HER2 gene copy number of < 6 per nucleus; or",
        "  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0-1+; or",
        "  IHC 2+ and FISH-negative or CISH-negative",
        "  The tumor must have been determined to be ER+ and/or progesterone positive (PgR+) defined as > 10% tumor staining by immunohistochemistry",
        "  The patient must have been evaluated by a treating physician, reviewed and discussed by the multi-disciplinary breast team, and considered to be a candidate for chemotherapy",
        "Exclusion Criteria:",
        "  FNA alone to diagnose the primary tumor",
        "  Excisional biopsy or lumpectomy performed prior to randomization",
        "  Surgical axillary staging procedure or sentinel node (SN) biopsy performed prior to registration",
        "  Tumors clinically staged as including inflammatory breast cancer",
        "  Ipsilateral cN2b or cN3 disease (patients with cN1 or cN2a disease are eligible)",
        "  Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease (Note: chest imaging [mandatory for all patients] and other imaging [if required] must have been performed within 6 weeks prior to randomization)",
        "  Synchronous or metachronous contralateral invasive breast cancer; (patients with synchronous and/or metachronous contralateral ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible)",
        "  HER2 test result of IHC 3+, regardless of FISH results, if performed",
        "  Any history of ipsilateral invasive breast cancer or ipsilateral DCIS if treated with radiation therapy (RT); (patients with synchronous or metachronous ipsilateral LCIS are eligible)",
        "  History of non-breast malignancies, except for in situ cancers treated only by local excision and basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, within 5 years prior to randomization",
        "  Treatment including RT, chemotherapy, and/or targeted therapy for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to registration",
        "  Cardiac disease (history of and/or active disease) that would preclude the use of chemotherapy",
        "  Pregnancy or lactation at the time of randomization; (Note: pregnancy testing must be performed within 2 weeks prior to randomization for women of childbearing potential)",
        "  Other non-malignant systemic disease that would preclude the patient from receiving study treatment or would prevent required follow-up",
        "  Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements",
        "  Use of any investigational product within 30 days prior to registration"

        "  The Proportion of Patients With RS 11-25 Who Refused the Assigned Treatment",
        "  The primary purpose of this trial is to determine the feasibility of carrying out a large multi-center trial with a similar design. Feasibility, in terms of less than 1/3 of patients with intermediate (11-25) Recurrence Score (RS) who refused the assigned treatment (Group 2) or refused randomization between hormonal (Arm 1) or chemotherapy (Arm 2). The confidence interval will be 95%. The proportion (and 95% confidence interval) of patients with RS 11-25 who refuse the assigned treatment will be calculated.",
