Complete Response (CR) is complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease; no new lesions; no disease related symptoms; and normalization of markers and other abnormal lab values. Partial response (PR) applies only to patients with at least one measurable lesion. PR is greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of longest diameter of all target measurable lesions; no unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease and no new lesions. Confirmed response is two or more objective statuses a minimum of four weeks apart documented before progression or symptomatic deterioration.",
