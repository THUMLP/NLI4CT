Progression was based on tumor assessment made by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as a 20 percent (%) or greater increase in the sum of the Longest Diameter (LD) of the target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded or appearance of new lesions.",
