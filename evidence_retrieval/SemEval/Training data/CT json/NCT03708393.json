        "  Primary effectiveness endpoint was the specificity of Imagio [IUS+OA] compared to IUS alone at fixed 95-99% sensitivity (fSp) interpolated from the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, averaged across all 10 independent readers. Both imaging modalities (IUS alone and IUS+OA) were read for each subject (subject as own control). Results for each imaging modality compared to biopsy diagnosis or 12-month follow-up ruling of benign as determined by truth panel (ground truth).",
