Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV with or without trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae), one day later, patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation, no more than 7 weeks later, patients proceed to course 2; OR Patients receive high-dose carboplatin, thiotepa, and cyclophosphamide IV continuously over 4 days followed by autologous PBSC transplantation. After recover from high-dose chemotherapy and autologous PBSC transplantation, patients with stage IIIB or IIIC disease undergo radiotherapy to the chest wall and lymph nodes. Patients with stage IV disease undergo radiotherapy using helical tomotherapy or standard radiotherapy to oligometastatic sites."
