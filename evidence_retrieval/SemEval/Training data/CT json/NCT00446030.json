Grade 3/4 CHF symptoms included cardiac failure congestive, cardiomyopathy, and left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF). Echocardiography (ECG) or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scans were scheduled after Cycles 3 and 6 of chemotherapy, after every 3rd cycle of trastuzumab alone, at end of therapy and every 6 months at follow-up to measure changes in LVEF. Clinical symptoms e.g., shortness of breath, tachycardia, cough, neck vein distention, cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly were further investigated for CHF.",
