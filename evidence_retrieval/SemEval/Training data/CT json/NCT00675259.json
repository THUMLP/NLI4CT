        "  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy : Nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin on days 1, 8, and 15 in combination with bevacizumab on days 1 and 15 administered every 28 days for 5 cycles followed by 1 cycle with Nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin on days 1, 8, and 15. Definitive surgery with either lumpectomy or mastectomy along with axillary lymph node dissection for all pre neo adjuvant chemotherapy node-positive patients approximately 4-5 weeks after the completion of NCT. Use of additional adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy depends upon the treating physicians' judgment. Radiation therapy should begin no sooner than 6 weeks after breast cancer surgery. All hormone receptor positive patients will receive endocrine therapy. All patients will receive 6 months of adjuvant bevacizumab every 3 weeks. If using an adjuvant anthracycline-containing regimen then bevacizumab will be administered  3 weeks after completing the regimen."
