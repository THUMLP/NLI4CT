Progression is defined in RECIST v1.1 as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. This outcome measure is reported for all patients treated at the same dose level and is not separated into Phase I and Phase II. The phase I and phase II results are not separated as the timing of enrollment (early in phase 1 or later phase II) is not relevant to the outcome measure.",
