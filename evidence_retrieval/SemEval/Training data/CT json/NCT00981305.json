        "  Change of Pain Score of Female Sexual Function Index",
        "  The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a 19-item self-reported instrument used for assessing key dimensions of female sexual function over the past 4 weeks with a total of six domains being analyzed. Each of the six specific domains (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain) analyzed in the FSFI is scored on a scale ranging from 1.2 to 6.0 (desire), 0 to 6.0 (arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and pain) or 0.8 to 6.0 (satisfaction), with higher scores indicating better performance. The total score, falling in a possible range from 2.0 to 36.0, is obtained by adding the six domain scores together.",
