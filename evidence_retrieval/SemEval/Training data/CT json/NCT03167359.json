Grade 1: Mild or localized; topical intervention indicated. Grade 2: Intense or widespread; intermittent; skin changes from scratching (e.g., edema, papulation, excoriations, lichenification, oozing/crusts); limiting instrumental ADLs. Grade 3-4: Severe or life-threatening. The higher the grade, the worse the outcome.",
