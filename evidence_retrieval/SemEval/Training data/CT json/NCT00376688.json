        "  Either the primary or metastatic tumor must be positive for estrogen receptor (>= 1% by immunohistochemical staining) and/or progesterone receptor (>= 1% by immunohistochemical staining) and/or human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2neu) (3+ immunohistochemical staining or fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] positive)",
        "  Patients must have measurable disease; measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as >= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan",
        "  There are no limitations on the number of prior therapy regimens; however, patients who have had prior exposure to rapamycin or any other mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor are excluded from the trial",
        "  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1",
        "  Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,500/uL",
        "  Platelets >= 100,000/uL",

        "  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to treatment on study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with temsirolimus",
        "  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document",
        "  Tissue for correlative studies must be available and the subject must agree to use of tissue for these studies",
        "Exclusion Criteria:",
        "  Patients must be off of hormonal agents used for the treatment of breast cancer for one week with the exception that premenopausal women who have been on a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and subsequently progressed may, at the discretion of the treating physician, continue on the GnRH agonist",
        "  Patients should have recovered from the adverse effects of prior chemotherapy; in general, this will mean that the patient would have been due or overdue for the next dose of the prior regimen: three weeks should have elapsed for a regimen administered once every three weeks, etc",
        "  Radiotherapy should have been completed",
        "  Three weeks should have elapsed since prior therapy with monoclonal antibodies",
        "  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or herbal preparations; patients may not be taking corticosteroids except in low doses as replacement for adrenal insufficiency or for short -term (less than 5 days) use for other reasons",

        "  Patients cannot be receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs [EIAEDs]; e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) nor any other CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampin or St. John's wort, as these may decrease temsirolimus levels; use of agents that potently inhibit CYP3A (and hence may raise temsirolimus levels), such as ketoconazole, is discouraged, but not specifically prohibited; CCI-779 can inhibit CYP2D6, and may decrease metabolism (and increase drug levels) of drugs that are substrates for CYP2D6, such as codeine; the appropriateness of use of such agents is left to physician discretion; if there is any doubt about eligibility based on concomitant medication, the study chair, Dr Fleming, should be contacted; all concomitant medications must be recorded",
        "  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements",
