Diagnosis of progressive disease was done according to RECIST (Version 1.0) and/or investigator assessment based on RECIST. RECIST criteria used changes in the largest diameter of target/non-target lesions. Target (measurable) lesions were up to a maximum of 5 per organ & >20 mm by clinical imaging (>=10 mm with spiral CT scan). Non-target lesions were all other lesions.",
