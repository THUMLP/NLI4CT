        "  Patients must have completed radiation treatment > 4 weeks prior to study entry; previously radiated area(s) must not be the only site of disease",
        "  All major surgical procedures must be completed > 4 weeks prior to study entry; placement of vascular access device or tissue biopsy will not be considered major surgery",
        "  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately",
        "  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document",

        "  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents; patients may not have received prior GTI-2040",
        "  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events",
        "  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to GTI-2040 or to capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil",
        "  Patients requiring anticoagulant therapy; low-dose anticoagulant (warfarin 1 mg per day) for the primary prophylaxis of venous catheter-associated thrombosis is permitted",
        "  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements",
        "  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because GTI-2040 and capecitabine have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with GTI-2040 and capecitabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated",
        "  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with GTI-2040 or other agents administered during the study; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated"

        "  1st 3 pts will be treated on arm 2. If 0/3 DLTs observed, the dose will be escalated to arm 3. If 1/3 DLTs onserved on arm 2, 3 more pts will be treated on arm 2. If no additional DLTs are observed on arm 2, the dose will be escalated to arm 3. If at most 1/6 DLTs observed on arm 3, arm 3 will be considered the MTD. If more than 1/6 DLTs observed on arm 3, the dose will be de-escalated to arm 2. If at most 1/6 DLTs observed on arm 2, arm 2 will be considered the MTD. If more than 1/6 pts on arm 2 experience a DLT, the dose will be de-escalated to arm 1. The remaining pts will be treated on arm 1 as the MTD, unless more than 1/6 DLTs, in which case the study will stop. DLT is defined as any grade III or IV non-hematologic toxicity (incl. diarrhea w\\ adequate antidiarrheal treatment & hydration & nausea/vomiting w\\ maximal antiemetic prophylaxis, as per protocol) or grade IV hematologic toxicity. DLT will be based on the 1st course of treatment according to the revised NCI CTC v 2.0",
