Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia lasting 7 consecutive days; 2. Grade 4 neutropenia with fever and/or infection; 3. Platelet count <10,000/mm^3; 4. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; 5. Any other Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity, with following exceptions: Grade 3 nausea/emesis, Grade 3 diarrhoea, Grade 3 fatigue, Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity that could be controlled to Grade 2 with appropriate treatment; 6. Other alisertib-related nonhematologic toxicities Grade 2 that, in opinion of investigator, required a dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy with alisertib.",
