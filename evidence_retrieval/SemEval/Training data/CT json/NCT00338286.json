        "  Progression Free Survival",
        "  Progression free survival was based in investigator-determined progressive disease (PD) and calculated from the date of randomization to the date of PD or the date of death, whichever occurred first. Participants who had not progressed and were still alive at the time of clinical cut off were censored at the last disease assessment prior to the clinical cutoff. For PD or death with a missing interval immediately preceding the event, progression-free survival (PFS) was censored at the last disease assessment prior to the missing interval. Participants who withdrew from the study (withdrawal of consent or lost to follow-up) without progression were censored at the time of the last disease assessment.",
