primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Progression-free Survival (PFS) and to Evaluate Safety of the Trastuzumab, Bevacizumab and Docetaxel Regimen.	The trial was designed as a single-stage phase II rather then usual two-stage design because of the progression free survival (PFS) primary endpoint, as it is impractical to wait to assess PFS for patients in the first stage. We will consider a PFS of 50% at twelve months (median PFS of 12 months) or less uninteresting and a PFS of 70% at twelve months (median PFS of twenty months) worthy of pursuing the regimen in a future trials. The single-stage design is as follows: p0=0.50, p1=0.70, α=0.10, β= 0.10. This leads to a total sample size of 39 patients, 24 or higher of who are progression-free at 12 months.

For subjects without recurrence, progression or death, it is censored at the last valid tumor assessment. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Here, the time to event was reported as the restricted mean survival time. The restricted mean survival time was defined as the area under the curve of the survival function up to 24 months.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Severity of Dermatitis in Radiation Treatment Site in Breast Cancer Patients	The severity of radiation dermatitis was measured using the Radiation Dermatitis Severity (RDS)Scale which ranges from 0.0 to 4.0 with increments of 0.5. The RDS scale is a revised form of the NIH Common Toxicity Criteria to account for color and subtle texture changes in the skin. The worst dermatitis (i.e., highest RDS score) at the end of treatment was used for the primary analysis of severity of radiation dermatitis in each treatment group. Additionally, we performed repeated measure analyses to examine the severity of dermatitis over time in each arm.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Progression-free Survival (PFS) and to Evaluate Safety of the Trastuzumab, Bevacizumab and Docetaxel Regimen.	The trial was designed as a single-stage phase II rather then usual two-stage design because of the progression free survival (PFS) primary endpoint, as it is impractical to wait to assess PFS for patients in the first stage.
