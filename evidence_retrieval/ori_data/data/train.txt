The patients may only be included in the study if ALL of the following statements are FULLFILLED:	The patient (male or female) is at least 18 years old at the time of signature of the informed consent form.	Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient prior to the performance of any protocol-specific procedure.	The patient is diagnosed with confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease.	Note: If the metastatic disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology or histology.	The patient has documented disease progression or relapse following at least one prior standard therapy with trastuzumab (alone or in combination with chemotherapy).	Patients with prior lapatinib use are eligible. Furthermore,	The administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) should have been stopped for at least 28 days by the time of the first ASCI administration.	The administration of trastuzumab alone could be maintained after chemotherapy, but the last dose of trastuzumab should not have been given less than three weeks before the first ASCI administration.	The patient will not be given trastuzumab during the trial.	For metastatic patients whose disease is ER+ and/or PR+ the following criteria should be met:	Patients with visceral disease that requires chemotherapy (eg., patients with liver or lung metastases).	Rapidly progressing or life threatening disease, as determined by the investigator.	Patients who received hormonal therapy and are no longer benefiting from this therapy.	A tumor lesion from the patient biopsied before or during screening shows either:	Overexpression of the HER2 protein, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC, with result IHC 3+) or	Amplification of the HER2 gene as determined by FISH (at least 4 fold i.e. at least 8 copies).	Note: Overexpression/amplification measurements must be performed on a metastatic lesion in all cases where such a lesion is sufficiently easily accessible. If however such a biopsy is not possible, then these measurements can be performed on the primary tumor. Use of the primary tumor is to be documented and justified.	Ten FFPE tissue sections of the tumor on which the HER2 overexpression/amplification has been done -if available-may be requested. These may be used to retrospectively carry out part of the translational research (i.e. analysis of EGF receptor activity and of the presence of immune effector cells, refer to Section 7).	The patient has at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria.	The patient has ECOG status of 0 or 1.	The patient has adequate bone marrow reserve as indicated by:	White blood cell count >/= 3,000/mm3.	Neutrophil count >/= 1,500/mm3.	Platelet count >/= 100,000/mm3.	Hemoglobin levels >/= 10.0 g/dl.	The patient has adequate renal function as shown by the creatinine levels (i.e. within the normal range).	The patient has adequate hepatic function as shown by serum bilirubin levels i.e:	Serum bilirubin levels within the normal limits.	Both AST and ALT levels <1.5 times the ULN. Note: However, for patients with liver metastasis, a serum bilirubin level <1.5 times the ULN and both AST and ALT levels <3 times the ULN will be accepted.	The patient has a baseline Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) measured by MUGA scan equal to or greater than the LLN for the radiology facility.	If the patient is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e. have a current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or be post-menopausal, or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to treatment, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for two months after completion of the study treatment.	Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive method with failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (when applicable, as mentioned in the product label) for example abstinence, combined or progestogen oral contraceptives, injectable progestogen, implants of levonorgestrel, oestrogenic vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches or intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), vasectomy with documented azoospermia of the sole male partner or double barrier method (condom or occlusive cap plus spermicidal agent).	For azoospermia, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/ designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records.	Post-menopause: Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation of menstrual cycles, menses, and implies the loss of reproductive potential by ovarian failure. A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate clinical profile at the appropriate age e.g. > 45 years.	Able to swallow and retain oral medication.	In the view of the investigator, the patient can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.	Exclusion Criteria:	The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry.

The patient has received any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study treatment(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study treatment, or planned use during the study period.	The patient is currently receiving amiodarone or has received amiodarone in the 6 months prior to screening.	The patient requires concomitant treatment with systemic corticosteroids or any immunosuppressive agents. The use of prednisone, or equivalent, <0.5 mg/kg/day (absolute maximum 40 mg/day), or inhaled corticosteroids or topical steroids is permitted.	The patient has a malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel.	Patients with ulcerative colitis.

primary trial Inclusion Criteria:	The following criteria are to be checked at the time of study entry. The patients may only be included in the study if ALL of the following statements are FULLFILLED:	The patient (male or female) is at least 18 years old at the time of signature of the informed consent form.	Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient prior to the performance of any protocol-specific procedure.	The patient is diagnosed with confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease.	Note: If the metastatic disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology or histology.	The patient has documented disease progression or relapse following at least one prior standard therapy with trastuzumab (alone or in combination with chemotherapy).	Patients with prior lapatinib use are eligible. Furthermore,	The administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) should have been stopped for at least 28 days by the time of the first ASCI administration.	The administration of trastuzumab alone could be maintained after chemotherapy, but the last dose of trastuzumab should not have been given less than three weeks before the first ASCI administration.	The patient will not be given trastuzumab during the trial.	For metastatic patients whose disease is ER+ and/or PR+ the following criteria should be met:	Patients with visceral disease that requires chemotherapy (eg., patients with liver or lung metastases).	Rapidly progressing or life threatening disease, as determined by the investigator.	Patients who received hormonal therapy and are no longer benefiting from this therapy.	A tumor lesion from the patient biopsied before or during screening shows either:	Overexpression of the HER2 protein, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC, with result IHC 3+) or	Amplification of the HER2 gene as determined by FISH (at least 4 fold i.e. at least 8 copies).	Note: Overexpression/amplification measurements must be performed on a metastatic lesion in all cases where such a lesion is sufficiently easily accessible. If however such a biopsy is not possible, then these measurements can be performed on the primary tumor. Use of the primary tumor is to be documented and justified.	Ten FFPE tissue sections of the tumor on which the HER2 overexpression/amplification has been done -if available-may be requested. These may be used to retrospectively carry out part of the translational research (i.e. analysis of EGF receptor activity and of the presence of immune effector cells, refer to Section 7).	The patient has at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria.	The patient has ECOG status of 0 or 1.	The patient has adequate bone marrow reserve as indicated by:	White blood cell count >/= 3,000/mm3.	Neutrophil count >/= 1,500/mm3.	Platelet count >/= 100,000/mm3.	Hemoglobin levels >/= 10.0 g/dl.

The patient has adequate hepatic function as shown by serum bilirubin levels i.e:	Serum bilirubin levels within the normal limits.	Both AST and ALT levels <1.5 times the ULN. Note: However, for patients with liver metastasis, a serum bilirubin level <1.5 times the ULN and both AST and ALT levels <3 times the ULN will be accepted.	The patient has a baseline Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) measured by MUGA scan equal to or greater than the LLN for the radiology facility.	If the patient is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e. have a current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or be post-menopausal, or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to treatment, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for two months after completion of the study treatment.	Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive method with failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (when applicable, as mentioned in the product label) for example abstinence, combined or progestogen oral contraceptives, injectable progestogen, implants of levonorgestrel, oestrogenic vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches or intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), vasectomy with documented azoospermia of the sole male partner or double barrier method (condom or occlusive cap plus spermicidal agent).	For azoospermia, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/ designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records.	Post-menopause: Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation of menstrual cycles, menses, and implies the loss of reproductive potential by ovarian failure. A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate clinical profile at the appropriate age e.g. > 45 years.	Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

Note: If the cardiac imaging facility cannot provide a LLN, use 50% as the LLN value.	Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if bevacizumab therapy can be continued following doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) and postoperatively, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the MUGA scan or echocardiogram must be repeated prior to study entry. The lower of the two LVEF values should be used as the baseline LVEF.

Progression-free Survival (PFS) According to Response Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) Based on Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)	PFS was defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease, or death, whichever occurs first. Response was assessed according to RECIST 1.1 by BICR. According to RECIST 1.1, progressive disease (PD) was defined as a 20% relative increase in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the nadir SOD and an absolute increase of >5 mm in the SOD, or the appearance of new lesions. PFS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and median PFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) in weeks was reported for each treatment arm. Per protocol, participants remained on assigned treatment until disease progression. Participants who discontinued study treatment for reasons other than disease progression continued to be assessed by imaging until objective documentation of progression.

primary trial Inclusion Criteria:	Patients must be female.	The patient must be greater than/equal to 18 years old	The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy or limited incisional biopsy.	Patients must have clinical Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] staging criteria) with a primary breast tumor that is greater than/equal to 2.0 cm measured by clinical exam, unless the patient has inflammatory breast carcinoma, in which case measurable disease is not required.	Patients must have the ability to swallow oral medication.	The patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be 0 or 1.	At the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria:	Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.	Platelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm^3.	Hemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.	The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:	total bilirubin must be less than/equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and	alkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and	aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.	Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.	Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or positron emission tomography (PET) scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or biopsy.	Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (computed tomography [CT], MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease and adequate hepatic function.	The following criteria for evidence of adequate renal function must be met:	Serum creatinine less than/equal to ULN for the lab.	Calculated creatinine clearance must be greater than 50 mL/min.	Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0.

The LVEF must be greater than/equal to the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the cardiac imaging facility performing the MUGA scan or echocardiogram. Note: If the cardiac imaging facility cannot provide a LLN, use 50% as the LLN value.	Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if bevacizumab therapy can be continued following doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) and postoperatively, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the MUGA scan or echocardiogram must be repeated prior to study entry. The lower of the two LVEF values should be used as the baseline LVEF.	Patients must have an electrocardiogram (EKG) within 3 months prior to study entry.

primary trial INTERVENTION 1:	Manual Lymph Drainage	Manual lymph drainage (MLD) treatment 3 times a week for 4 weeks to the lymphedematous upper limb	Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD): MLD is a practitioner-applied manual massage technique designed to decrease limb volume in patients with lymphedema by enhancing movement of lymph fluid, resulting in reductions in interstitial fluid.	INTERVENTION 2:	Negative Pressure	PhysioTouch (negative pressure massage) treatment 3 times a week for 4 weeks to the lymphedematous upper limb	PhysioTouch: The PhysioTouch is a hand-held device that administers negative pressure under the treatment head, and gently pulls the underlying skin and subcutaneous tissue into the suction cup. This suction produces a stretch to the skin and in the subcutaneous tissue space. This action is thought to facilitate lymphatic flow from the interstitium into the lymphatic vessels, and mobilizes the superficial fascia.

At the time of randomization, the patient must have had the following: history and physical exam, EKG, and imaging of the chest within the past 3 months and bilateral mammogram within the past 6 months.	Within 3 months prior to entry, the patient must have a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), measured by Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram, greater than or equal to lower limit of normal (LLN) for the facility performing the procedure and no evidence of regional wall abnormalities.	Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for 5 or more years prior to randomization and are deemed by their physician to be at low risk for recurrence. Patients with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.	Special conditions for eligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery. Patients treated by lumpectomy must meet all the eligibility criteria in addition to the following:	Generally, lumpectomy should be reserved for tumors less than 5 cm. However, at the investigator's discretion, patients treated with lumpectomy for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm are eligible if eligibility criteria for lumpectomy are met.	The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. In patients for whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary evaluation has been completed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection.)	Irradiation of regional lymph nodes is optional, but plans for radiation therapy must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes.	Special conditions for eligibility of mastectomy patients: radiation therapy o Postmastectomy chest wall and/or regional nodal irradiation is optional. Plans for radiation in mastectomy patients must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes.	Ineligibility Criteria	Male patients are not eligible for this study. Women with one or more of the following conditions or prior therapies are also ineligible for this study:	Tumor that has been determined to be human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive by immunohistochemistry (3+) or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (positive for gene amplification).	Contralateral breast cancer (invasive or DCIS) or a mass or mammographic abnormality in the opposite breast suspicious for malignancy unless there is biopsy proof that the mass is not malignant.	Primary tumor staged as T4 for any reason.	Clinical nodal stages including cN2b and cN3 or pathologic nodal stages including pN0(i+), pN2b, pN3b with clinically apparent internal mammary nodes, or pN3c.	Suspicious nodes in the contralateral axilla or suspicious supraclavicular nodes. Patients with these conditions are considered ineligible unless there is biopsy evidence that these are not involved with tumor.	Prior history of breast cancer, including DCIS (patients with a history of LCIS are eligible).	Treatment, including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to randomization. One exception is hormonal therapy, which may have been given for up to a total of 28 days anytime after diagnosis and before study entry. In such a case, hormonal therapy must stop at or before randomization and be re-started, if indicated, following chemotherapy. A second exception is radiation therapy for patients enrolled in NSABP B-39 and assigned to partial breast irradiation (Group 2). These patients may have received RT prior to B-38 study entry.	Prior therapy with anthracyclines or taxanes for any malignancy.	Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to randomization.)	Therapy with any hormonal agents such as raloxifene (Evista®), tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), either for osteoporosis or breast cancer prevention. (Patients are eligible only if these medications are discontinued prior to randomization.	Cardiac disease that would preclude the use of anthracyclines. This includes:	history of myocardial infarction documented by elevated cardiac enzymes or regional wall abnormalities on assessment of left ventricular (LV) function;	angina pectoris that requires the use of anti-anginal medication;	any history of documented congestive heart failure;	serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication;	severe conduction abnormality;	valvular disease with documented cardiac function compromise; and	uncontrolled hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 160/100 on antihypertensive therapy.	Conditions that would prohibit administration of corticosteroids.	Sensory/motor neuropathy greater than or equal to grade 2, as defined by the NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0.	Non-malignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would preclude a patient from receiving any of the treatment options or would prevent prolonged follow-up.	History of hepatitis B or C.	Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception.	Concurrent treatment with other investigational agents for the treatment of breast cancer.	Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.	Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery	For patients treated by lumpectomy, whole breast irradiation is required.	The following patients will be ineligible:	Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) treated with lumpectomy. (These patients are eligible if they undergo mastectomy.)	Patients treated with lumpectomy in whom there is another clinically dominant mass or mammographically suspicious abnormality within the ipsilateral breast remnant. Such a mass must be biopsied and demonstrated to be histologically benign prior to randomization or, if malignant, must be surgically removed with clear margins.	Patients in whom the margins of the resected specimen are involved with invasive tumor or DCIS.	Patients with cancer cells that have metastasised into less than 3 lymph nodes, with at least one larger than 2mm, cannot enter the primary trial.

secondary trial INTERVENTION 1:	Arm 1: BREASTChoice (Decision Tool)	Investigators recruited patients scheduled for a plastic/reconstruction consult. Investigators identified patients who completed a mastectomy, or were scheduled for one, and considering reconstruction, but didn't have an appointment with a plastic/reconstructive surgeon. A study team member called the patient to determine their interest and offered for them to come to their scheduled appointment 30 minutes early to meet a coordinator or offered them the option to complete pre-appointment procedures at home. Patients randomized using computer random assignment. If the patient didn't have an appointment, she scheduled a convenient time to complete study procedures with research staff. Patients interacted with the decision tool. They were asked to answer a survey. After the appointment, the team collected information consult duration, decision process quality, and measures of shared decision making. Patient participation was approximately 30 minutes.

Investigators identified patients who completed or scheduled a mastectomy, and considering reconstruction, but didn't have an appointment with a plastic/reconstructive surgeon. A study team member called the patient to determine their interest and offered for them to come to their scheduled appointment 30 minutes early to meet a coordinator or to complete the pre-appointment procedures at home. Patients were randomized using computer random assignment. If the patient didn't have an appointment, she scheduled a convenient time to complete study procedures with research staff. Patients interacted with American Society of Plastic Surgeons booklet "Breast Reconstruction." They were asked to answer a survey. After the appointment, the team collected information about consult duration, decision process quality, and measures of shared decision making. Patient participation was approximately 30 minutes.	the secondary trial and the primary trial are evaluating interventions associated with breast reconstruction for patients that have had mastectomies.

Participants were treated at each dose level (DL) for minimum of 21 days before accrual to the next DL. Rules for dose escalation: If 0 dose level toxicity (DLT) was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, the next higher cohort was opened to accrual. If 1 DLT was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, then 3 additional participants were studied. If 0 DLT was observed in those 3 (ie, 1 DLT in 6 subjects at the DL), the next higher cohort was opened for accrual. If >=2 DLT was observed in up to 6 subjects, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded and the next lower DL was defined as the MTD. If 0 DLT was observed in 6 participants in a cohort and the next higher DL exceeded the MTD, then intermediate DLs would be studied.

secondary trial Outcome Measurement:	Time to Progression as Evaluated by the Investigator	Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the earliest date of progression of disease (PD) or death due to breast cancer. The investigator assessed PD based on radiological PD (imaging data) and clinical symptomatic progress (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] Criteria: target lesion (TL), at least a 20% increase in the sum of largest diameter (LD) of TLs or the appearance of one or more new lesions; non-TL (NTL), the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing NTLs). TTP was assessed in participants who died due to breast cancer or progressed, as assessed by the investigator, as well as in those who were censored and completed follow-up and those who were censored but are still being followed. For censored participants (those without a documented date of disease progression/death due to breast cancer), the date of the last radiographic assessment was used.

CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters. Possible CR and PR had to be confirmed no fewer than 4 weeks after the initial response assessment. A brain and bone scan was performed by CT/MRI within 1 week after confirmation of a response to ensure no new metastases. To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements had to be confirmed by repeat evaluations, to be performed not fewer than 4 weeks after the response criteria were first met.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Centrally Assessed Progression Free Survival	Progression Free Survival (PFS), Measured in Months, for Randomized Subjects of the Central Assessment. The time interval from the date of randomization until the first date on which recurrence, progression (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.1), or death due to any cause, is documented. For subjects without recurrence, progression or death, it is censored at the last valid tumor assessment. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Here, the time to event was reported as the restricted mean survival time. The restricted mean survival time was defined as the area under the curve of the survival function up to 24 months.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Percentage of Participants With Feasibility	The regimen was considered feasible if the participant was able to complete the eribulin portion without dose delay or reduction. Dose delay was defined as a delay due to eribulin-related adverse event (AE) for more than 2 days for subsequent doses (cycles after the initiation of full dose of eribulin, except holidays, scheduling difficulties and nonclinical logistical issues). If a participant had more than 1 dose omission, delay or reduction due to eribulin-related AE, these events were collectively counted as one entity in the same participant. Participants were followed for approximately 3 years after the last dose of the study treatment. Feasibility rates were calculated with or without growth factor support. In both cohorts, the percentage of participants who completed the eribulin portion of the regimen without a dose omission, delay or reduction due to eribulin-related AE was estimated via the observed completion rate and an exact 90% confidence interval (CI) was constructed.

primary trial INTERVENTION 1:	Decongestive Physiotherapy	This group received Complex Decongestive Physiotherapy.	Decongestive Physiotherapy: This group received CDP, which include MLD, short-stretch bandages, lymph-reducing exercises, and skin care. MLD was applied to the anterior trunk, posterior trunk, and the base of the neck, progressing to the affected limb. Short-stretch bandages were applied in multiple layers after MLD. A low pH skin lotion was applied prior to bandaging and then stockinette was placed on the arm. The fingers and the hand were wrapped in gauze. A layer of cotton was wrapped around the arm. Bandages (6, 8 and/or 10cm) were sequentially applied in a spiral fashion around the limb with the smallest bandage starting at the hand. The most compression was at the most distal points and gradually decreased proximally. Exercises were done by patients to improve mobility and enhance lymphatic flow.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Progression Free Survival (PFS)	To determine whether MM-121 + exemestane was more effective than placebo + exemestane in prolonging progression-free survival. PFS was a time to event measure, and progression of disease is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), "as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions". Progression free survival was defined as the number of months from the date of randomization to the date of death or progression. If neither death nor progression was observed during the study, PFS data was censored at the last non-progressive disease valid tumor assessment unless the patient was discontinued due to symptomatic deterioration.

primary trial Eligibility	Patients must have undergone either a total mastectomy or a lumpectomy with either an axillary dissection or sentinel node biopsy. If any sentinel node is histologically positive by H & E, or histologically suspicious on H & E and confirmed positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC), then the patient must have a completion axillary dissection.	The tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma on histologic examination with clinical assessment T1-3, N0-1, M0.	Patients must not be participating in any other clinical trials of systemic therapy for early-stage breast cancer. Patients may participate in the following radiation therapy trials:	Node-positive patients may participate in the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group protocol MA.20, provided the requirements of the B-34 protocol continue to be met. (Node-negative B-34 patients may not participate in MA.20.)	Node-positive mastectomy patients may participate in Southwest Oncology Group protocol S9927, provided the requirements of the B-34 protocol continue to be met.	Patients must have an analysis of both estrogen and progesterone receptors on the primary tumor performed prior to randomization. Tumors will be defined as ER or progesterone receptor (PgR) positive if: 1) the Dextran-coated charcoal or sucrose-density gradient method shows them to have greater than or equal to 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein, or 2) if using individual laboratory criteria they can be shown to be positive by the enzyme immunoassay method (EIA) or immunocytochemical assay. "Marginal or borderline," results (i.e., those not definitively negative) will also be considered positive.	At the time of randomization, the patient must have had the following within the past 3 months: history and physical exam, a bone scan, thoracic and lumbar spine x-rays, and a chest x-ray. Within the past 12 months patients must have had a gynecologic exam (for women who have a uterus and who will be taking tamoxifen) and a bilateral mammogram.	At the time of randomization:	the postoperative absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal to 1500/mm3 (or less than 1500/mm3 if, in the opinion of the investigator, this represents an ethnic or racial variation of normal);	the postoperative platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000;	there must be postoperative evidence of adequate hepatic function, i.e.,	total bilirubin at or below the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory; and	alkaline phosphatase less than 2.5 x the ULN; and	the serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT)/ aspartate transaminase (AST) less than 1.5 x the ULN;	there must be postoperative evidence of adequate renal function (serum creatinine within or less than the laboratory's normal range).	Serum albumin and serum calcium must be within normal limits.	A patient with skeletal pain is eligible for inclusion in the study if bone scan and/or roentgenological examination fails to disclose metastatic disease. Suspicious findings must be confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy.	Patients with prior nonbreast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease- free for greater than or equal to 5 years before randomization and are deemed at low risk for recurrence by their treating physicians. Patients with squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin that has been effectively treated, carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been treated by surgery only, or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) of the ipsilateral or contralateral breast treated by hormone therapy and/or surgery only are eligible, even if these were diagnosed within 5 years before randomization.	Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0, 1, or 2.	Special conditions for eligibility of lumpectomy patients: Irradiation and surgery. Patients treated by lumpectomy and axillary node dissection (or no axillary dissection if sentinel node biopsy is negative) to be followed by breast radiation therapy must meet all the eligibility criteria in addition to the following:	Generally, lumpectomy should be reserved for tumors less than 5 cm. However, at the investigator's discretion, patients treated with lumpectomy for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm are eligible.	The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). For patients in whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary dissection has been performed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margins after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible.	Ineligibility.	Significant non-malignant bone disease that is likely to interfere with the interpretation of bone x-rays.	Ulceration, erythema, infiltration of the skin or the underlying chest wall (complete fixation), peau d'orange, or skin edema of any magnitude. (Tethering or dimpling of the skin or nipple inversion should not be interpreted as skin infiltration. Patients with these conditions are eligible.)	Ipsilateral lymph nodes that on clinical examination are found to be fixed to one another or to other structures (cN2 disease).	Suspicious palpable nodes in the contralateral axilla or palpable supraclavicular or infraclavicular nodes, unless there is biopsy evidence that these are not involved with tumor.	Prior therapy for breast cancer, including irradiation, chemotherapy, biotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy, with the exception of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen may be given as adjuvant therapy before study entry, but only if it was started within 28 days before randomization. Patients who started tamoxifen within 28 days before randomization and who are being considered for chemotherapy must have their tamoxifen stopped at the start of chemotherapy.	Prior history of breast cancer, except LCIS.	Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible only if this therapy is discontinued prior to randomization.) Exceptions: patients may use low-dose estrogen vaginal creams or Estring® for symptomatic vaginal dryness, raloxifene (or other selective estrogen receptor modulators [SERMs]) for the prevention of osteoporosis, and luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists/antagonists for the purpose of medical ovarian ablation as a component of adjuvant therapy for the breast cancer.	Patients currently taking alendronate (Fosamax®) or other bisphosphonates or calcitonin to treat or prevent osteoporosis are not eligible.	Non-malignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would preclude a patient from being subjected to any of the treatment options or would prevent prolonged follow-up.	Psychiatric or addictive disorders that would preclude obtaining informed consent.	Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. This protocol excludes pregnant or lactating women because the effects of clodronate on such women have not been studied fully.	Bilateral malignancy or a mass or mammographic abnormality in the opposite breast suspicious for malignancy unless there is biopsy proof that the mass is not malignant.	Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: Irradiation and surgery. The following patients will also be ineligible:	Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) that would not be considered surgically amenable to lumpectomy.	Patients treated with lumpectomy in whom there is another clinically dominant mass or mammographically suspicious abnormality within the ipsilateral breast remnant. Such a mass must be biopsied and demonstrated to be histologically benign prior to randomization or, if malignant, must be surgically removed with clear margins.	Patients in whom the margins of the resected specimen are involved with invasive tumor or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Additional surgical resections to obtain free margins are allowed. Patients in whom tumor is still present after the additional resection(s) must undergo mastectomy to be eligible.	Patients with a positive sentinel node biopsy must have surgery to remove lymph nodes from the groin or they will not be eligible for the primary trial.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Percentage of Participants With Feasibility	The regimen was considered feasible if the participant was able to complete the eribulin portion without dose delay or reduction. Dose delay was defined as a delay due to eribulin-related adverse event (AE) for more than 2 days for subsequent doses (cycles after the initiation of full dose of eribulin, except holidays, scheduling difficulties and nonclinical logistical issues). If a participant had more than 1 dose omission, delay or reduction due to eribulin-related AE, these events were collectively counted as one entity in the same participant. Participants were followed for approximately 3 years after the last dose of the study treatment. Feasibility rates were calculated with or without growth factor support. In both cohorts, the percentage of participants who completed the eribulin portion of the regimen without a dose omission, delay or reduction due to eribulin-related AE was estimated via the observed completion rate and an exact 90% confidence interval (CI) was constructed.

primary trial Eligibility	Patients must have undergone either a total mastectomy or a lumpectomy with either an axillary dissection or sentinel node biopsy. If any sentinel node is histologically positive by H & E, or histologically suspicious on H & E and confirmed positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC), then the patient must have a completion axillary dissection.	The tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma on histologic examination with clinical assessment T1-3, N0-1, M0.	Patients must not be participating in any other clinical trials of systemic therapy for early-stage breast cancer. Patients may participate in the following radiation therapy trials:	Node-positive patients may participate in the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group protocol MA.20, provided the requirements of the B-34 protocol continue to be met. (Node-negative B-34 patients may not participate in MA.20.)	Node-positive mastectomy patients may participate in Southwest Oncology Group protocol S9927, provided the requirements of the B-34 protocol continue to be met.	Patients must have an analysis of both estrogen and progesterone receptors on the primary tumor performed prior to randomization. Tumors will be defined as ER or progesterone receptor (PgR) positive if: 1) the Dextran-coated charcoal or sucrose-density gradient method shows them to have greater than or equal to 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein, or 2) if using individual laboratory criteria they can be shown to be positive by the enzyme immunoassay method (EIA) or immunocytochemical assay. "Marginal or borderline," results (i.e., those not definitively negative) will also be considered positive.	At the time of randomization, the patient must have had the following within the past 3 months: history and physical exam, a bone scan, thoracic and lumbar spine x-rays, and a chest x-ray. Within the past 12 months patients must have had a gynecologic exam (for women who have a uterus and who will be taking tamoxifen) and a bilateral mammogram.	At the time of randomization:	the postoperative absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal to 1500/mm3 (or less than 1500/mm3 if, in the opinion of the investigator, this represents an ethnic or racial variation of normal);	the postoperative platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000;	there must be postoperative evidence of adequate hepatic function, i.e.,	total bilirubin at or below the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory; and	alkaline phosphatase less than 2.5 x the ULN; and	the serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT)/ aspartate transaminase (AST) less than 1.5 x the ULN;	there must be postoperative evidence of adequate renal function (serum creatinine within or less than the laboratory's normal range).	Serum albumin and serum calcium must be within normal limits.	A patient with skeletal pain is eligible for inclusion in the study if bone scan and/or roentgenological examination fails to disclose metastatic disease. Suspicious findings must be confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy.	Patients with prior nonbreast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease- free for greater than or equal to 5 years before randomization and are deemed at low risk for recurrence by their treating physicians. Patients with squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin that has been effectively treated, carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been treated by surgery only, or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) of the ipsilateral or contralateral breast treated by hormone therapy and/or surgery only are eligible, even if these were diagnosed within 5 years before randomization.	Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0, 1, or 2.	Special conditions for eligibility of lumpectomy patients: Irradiation and surgery. Patients treated by lumpectomy and axillary node dissection (or no axillary dissection if sentinel node biopsy is negative) to be followed by breast radiation therapy must meet all the eligibility criteria in addition to the following:	Generally, lumpectomy should be reserved for tumors less than 5 cm. However, at the investigator's discretion, patients treated with lumpectomy for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm are eligible.	The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). For patients in whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary dissection has been performed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margins after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible.	Ineligibility.	Significant non-malignant bone disease that is likely to interfere with the interpretation of bone x-rays.	Ulceration, erythema, infiltration of the skin or the underlying chest wall (complete fixation), peau d'orange, or skin edema of any magnitude. (Tethering or dimpling of the skin or nipple inversion should not be interpreted as skin infiltration. Patients with these conditions are eligible.)	Ipsilateral lymph nodes that on clinical examination are found to be fixed to one another or to other structures (cN2 disease).	Suspicious palpable nodes in the contralateral axilla or palpable supraclavicular or infraclavicular nodes, unless there is biopsy evidence that these are not involved with tumor.	Prior therapy for breast cancer, including irradiation, chemotherapy, biotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy, with the exception of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen may be given as adjuvant therapy before study entry, but only if it was started within 28 days before randomization. Patients who started tamoxifen within 28 days before randomization and who are being considered for chemotherapy must have their tamoxifen stopped at the start of chemotherapy.	Prior history of breast cancer, except LCIS.	Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible only if this therapy is discontinued prior to randomization.) Exceptions: patients may use low-dose estrogen vaginal creams or Estring® for symptomatic vaginal dryness, raloxifene (or other selective estrogen receptor modulators [SERMs]) for the prevention of osteoporosis, and luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists/antagonists for the purpose of medical ovarian ablation as a component of adjuvant therapy for the breast cancer.	Patients currently taking alendronate (Fosamax®) or other bisphosphonates or calcitonin to treat or prevent osteoporosis are not eligible.	Non-malignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would preclude a patient from being subjected to any of the treatment options or would prevent prolonged follow-up.	Psychiatric or addictive disorders that would preclude obtaining informed consent.	Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. This protocol excludes pregnant or lactating women because the effects of clodronate on such women have not been studied fully.	Bilateral malignancy or a mass or mammographic abnormality in the opposite breast suspicious for malignancy unless there is biopsy proof that the mass is not malignant.	Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: Irradiation and surgery. The following patients will also be ineligible:	Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) that would not be considered surgically amenable to lumpectomy.	Patients treated with lumpectomy in whom there is another clinically dominant mass or mammographically suspicious abnormality within the ipsilateral breast remnant. Such a mass must be biopsied and demonstrated to be histologically benign prior to randomization or, if malignant, must be surgically removed with clear margins.	Patients in whom the margins of the resected specimen are involved with invasive tumor or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Additional surgical resections to obtain free margins are allowed. Patients in whom tumor is still present after the additional resection(s) must undergo mastectomy to be eligible.	Patients with a positive sentinel node biopsy must have surgery to remove lymph nodes from the armpit (underarm or axilla) or they will not be eligible for the primary trial.

Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0.	All patients must have their LVEF assessed by 2-D echocardiogram within 3 months prior to study entry. (MUGA scan may be substituted for 2-D echocardiogram based on institutional preferences.) The LVEF must be greater than/equal to 55% regardless of the institution's LLN.	Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if trastuzumab and bevacizumab therapy can be administered, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the investigator is encouraged to have the accuracy of the initial LVEF result confirmed and to consider repeating the study if the accuracy is uncertain.	Exclusion Criteria:	Conditions for patient ineligibility (Cohort A)	FNA alone to diagnose the primary tumor.	Surgical axillary staging procedure prior to study entry. (Procedures that are permitted include: 1) FNA or core biopsy of an axillary node for any patient, and 2) although not recommended, a pre-neoadjuvant therapy SN biopsy for patients with clinically negative axillary nodes.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities Per Dose Level - Safety Population	Safety was assessed from first dose of study drug through at least 30 days after the last dose, until resolution of drug-related toxicity or when toxicity was deemed irreversible, whichever was longer. An adverse event (AE) was considered a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) if it occurred in the first 21 days and was at least possibly related to study drugs and were: Clinically-evident toxicity of Grade >= 3, or of Grade 2 which required interruption of treatment for >= 7 days (consecutive or non-consecutive); non-hematologic abnormal laboratory value of Grade >= 3, or hematologic toxicity of Grade 4, which persisted 7 days; any grade toxicity which in the judgment of the investigator required a dose reduction or removal from further study therapy.	Time frame: Day 1 to 30 days post last dose	Results 1:	Arm/Group Title: 50 mg Dasatinib + 825 mg/m^2Capecitabine	Arm/Group Description: Dose Level 1: 50 milligram (mg) dasatinib oral tablet twice daily (BID) plus 825 mg per meter squared (m^2) capecitabine oral tablet BID. Participants were treated at each dose level (DL) for minimum of 21 days before accrual to the next DL. Rules for dose escalation: If 0 dose level toxicity (DLT) was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, the next higher cohort was opened to accrual. If 1 DLT was observed in the first 3 participants in a cohort, then 3 additional participants were studied. If 0 DLT was observed in those 3 (ie, 1 DLT in 6 subjects at the DL), the next higher cohort was opened for accrual. If >=2 DLT was observed in up to 6 subjects, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded and the next lower DL was defined as the MTD. If 0 DLT was observed in 6 participants in a cohort and the next higher DL exceeded the MTD, then intermediate DLs would be studied. Once the MTD was determined, additional participants were enrolled into that dose group.

primary trial Inclusion Criteria:	Conditions for eligibility for patients with LABC (Cohort A):	The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy or limited incisional biopsy.	Patients must have clinical Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC disease with a mass in the breast or axilla that is greater than or equal to 2.0 cm measured by clinical exam, unless the patient has inflammatory breast carcinoma, in which case measurable disease is not required.	Conditions for eligibility for patients with resected Stage III breast cancer (Cohort B)	Patients must have undergone either a total mastectomy or a lumpectomy.	Patients must have completed one of the following procedures for evaluation of pathologic nodal status.	Sentinel lymphadenectomy followed by removal of additional non-sentinel lymph nodes, or	Axillary lymphadenectomy without SN isolation procedure.

For patients who undergo lumpectomy, the margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)	For patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.	Conditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)	The patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.	Patients must be female.	The patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.	The patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.	The tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.	The breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry. Assays performed using FISH require gene amplification. Assays using IHC require a strongly positive (3+) staining score.	At the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria:	Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.	Platelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm3.	Hemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.	The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:	total bilirubin must be less than/equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and	alkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and	AST must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.	Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.	Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease, and has adequate hepatic function.	Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or PET scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy.	Serum creatinine less than/equal to ULN for the lab.	Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0.	All patients must have their LVEF assessed by 2-D echocardiogram within 3 months prior to study entry. (MUGA scan may be substituted for 2-D echocardiogram based on institutional preferences.) The LVEF must be greater than/equal to 55% regardless of the institution's LLN.	Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if trastuzumab and bevacizumab therapy can be administered, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the investigator is encouraged to have the accuracy of the initial LVEF result confirmed and to consider repeating the study if the accuracy is uncertain.	Exclusion Criteria:	Conditions for patient ineligibility (Cohort A)	FNA alone to diagnose the primary tumor.	Surgical axillary staging procedure prior to study entry. (Procedures that are permitted include: 1) FNA or core biopsy of an axillary node for any patient, and 2) although not recommended, a pre-neoadjuvant therapy SN biopsy for patients with clinically negative axillary nodes.	Condition for patient ineligibility (Cohort B)	Breast reconstruction using tissue expanders or implants at the time of mastectomy.	Conditions for patient ineligibility (ALL patients)	Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease.	Synchronous bilateral invasive breast cancer.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Centrally Assessed Progression Free Survival	Progression Free Survival (PFS), Measured in Months, for Randomized Subjects of the Central Assessment. The time interval from the date of randomization until the first date on which recurrence, progression (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.1), or death due to any cause, is documented. For subjects without recurrence, progression or death, it is censored at the last valid tumor assessment. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Overall Survival (OS)	OS was measured from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, or the last date the participant was known to be alive. Participants who were lost to follow-up or who were alive at the date of data cutoff were censored. The censoring rules for OS were as follows: 1) if the participant was still alive at data cutoff, the date of data cutoff was considered the end date, and 2) if the participant was lost to follow-up before data cutoff, the date they were last known to be alive was considered the end date. Participants who survived past the end of the study were counted as in the full study period. If death occurred after data cutoff, the end date was to be censored at the time of data cutoff.

The patient must have a life expectancy of at least 10 years and a Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1. (Comorbid conditions but not the diagnosis of breast cancer should be taken into consideration when determining life expectancy.)	The interval between the last surgery for breast cancer staging or treatment and randomization must be no more than 84 days.	The tumor must be invasive carcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.	All of the following staging criteria must be met:	By clinical and pathologic evaluation, primary tumor must be T1-3;	By clinical evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be cN0, cN1, or cN2a;	By pathologic evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be pN1 (pN1mi, pN1a, pN1b, pN1c), pN2a, pN3a, or pN3b (only if due to microscopic involvement of internal mammary node detected by sentinel lymph node dissection and with more than 3 positive axillary lymph nodes).	Patients must have an estrogen receptor (ER) analysis performed on the primary tumor prior to randomization. If ER analysis is negative, then progesterone receptor (PgR) analysis must be performed. If ER analysis is positive, PgR analysis is desired, but not mandatory. ("Marginal" or "borderline" results [i.e., those not definitely negative] will be considered positive regardless of the methodology used.)	Patients must have had either a lumpectomy or a total mastectomy. Patients must have completed one of the following procedures for evaluation of pathologic nodal status.	Sentinel lymphadenectomy followed by removal of additional non-sentinel lymph nodes (This approach is strongly recommended.)	Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone if one of the following criteria is met:	Pathologic nodal staging based on sentinel lymphadenectomy is pN1mi or pN1b	Surgeon elects not to remove additional non-sentinel nodes (This approach is strongly discouraged, but will not preclude participation in B-38.)	Axillary lymphadenectomy without sentinel node isolation procedure.	Patients must have no clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease.	Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if bone scans fail to demonstrate metastatic disease. Suspicious findings on bone scan must be confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy.	Patients with aspartate transaminase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging fails to demonstrate metastatic disease and the following requirements are met at the time of randomization.

The following criteria for postoperative evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:	total bilirubin must be less than or equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome due to slow conjugation of bilirubin; and	alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and	the AST must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab; and	alkaline phosphatase and AST cannot both be greater than ULN.	Postoperative serum creatinine must be less than or equal to ULN.	At the time of randomization, the patient must have had the following: history and physical exam, EKG, and imaging of the chest within the past 3 months and bilateral mammogram within the past 6 months.	Within 3 months prior to entry, the patient must have a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), measured by Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram, greater than or equal to lower limit of normal (LLN) for the facility performing the procedure and no evidence of regional wall abnormalities.	Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for 5 or more years prior to randomization and are deemed by their physician to be at low risk for recurrence. Patients with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.	Special conditions for eligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery. Patients treated by lumpectomy must meet all the eligibility criteria in addition to the following:	Generally, lumpectomy should be reserved for tumors less than 5 cm. However, at the investigator's discretion, patients treated with lumpectomy for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm are eligible if eligibility criteria for lumpectomy are met.	The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. In patients for whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary evaluation has been completed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection.)	Irradiation of regional lymph nodes is optional, but plans for radiation therapy must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes.	Special conditions for eligibility of mastectomy patients: radiation therapy o Postmastectomy chest wall and/or regional nodal irradiation is optional. Plans for radiation in mastectomy patients must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes.	Ineligibility Criteria	Male patients are not eligible for this study. Women with one or more of the following conditions or prior therapies are also ineligible for this study:	Tumor that has been determined to be human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive by immunohistochemistry (3+) or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (positive for gene amplification).

Treatment, including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to randomization. One exception is hormonal therapy, which may have been given for up to a total of 28 days anytime after diagnosis and before study entry. In such a case, hormonal therapy must stop at or before randomization and be re-started, if indicated, following chemotherapy. A second exception is radiation therapy for patients enrolled in NSABP B-39 and assigned to partial breast irradiation (Group 2). These patients may have received RT prior to B-38 study entry.	Prior therapy with anthracyclines or taxanes for any malignancy.	Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to randomization.)

Concurrent treatment with other investigational agents for the treatment of breast cancer.	Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.	Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery	For patients treated by lumpectomy, whole breast irradiation is required.	The following patients will be ineligible:	Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) treated with lumpectomy. (These patients are eligible if they undergo mastectomy.)

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	1. Progression-free Survival (PFS) According to Response Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) Based on Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)	PFS was defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease, or death, whichever occurs first. Response was assessed according to RECIST 1.1 by BICR. According to RECIST 1.1, progressive disease (PD) was defined as a 20% relative increase in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the nadir SOD and an absolute increase of >5 mm in the SOD, or the appearance of new lesions. PFS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and median PFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) in weeks was reported for each treatment arm. Per protocol, participants remained on assigned treatment until disease progression. Participants who discontinued study treatment for reasons other than disease progression continued to be assessed by imaging until objective documentation of progression. All participants (including participants who discontinued study treatment) were followed for survival until investigator notification to discontinue.
