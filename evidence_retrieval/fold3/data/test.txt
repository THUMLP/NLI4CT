The MTD is identified as the level BELOW the cohort where DLT occurred in less than one third of patients within the cohort.	If no DLT's are observed, the MTD is not reached.	Time frame: Participants were assessed prior to each dose of paclitaxel with ruxolitinib; The observation period for MTD evaluation was the first 2 cycles of treatment. (Up to 8 weeks).

secondary trial Outcome Measurement:	Maximum Tolerated Dose Determined by Dose-limiting Toxicities	1st 3 pts will be treated on arm 2. If 0/3 DLTs observed, the dose will be escalated to arm 3. If 1/3 DLTs onserved on arm 2, 3 more pts will be treated on arm 2. If no additional DLTs are observed on arm 2, the dose will be escalated to arm 3. If at most 1/6 DLTs observed on arm 3, arm 3 will be considered the MTD. If more than 1/6 DLTs observed on arm 3, the dose will be de-escalated to arm 2. If at most 1/6 DLTs observed on arm 2, arm 2 will be considered the MTD. If more than 1/6 pts on arm 2 experience a DLT, the dose will be de-escalated to arm 1. The remaining pts will be treated on arm 1 as the MTD, unless more than 1/6 DLTs, in which case the study will stop. DLT is defined as any grade III or IV non-hematologic toxicity (incl. diarrhea w\ adequate antidiarrheal treatment & hydration & nausea/vomiting w\ maximal antiemetic prophylaxis, as per protocol) or grade IV hematologic toxicity.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Ruxolitinib Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) [Phase I]	Ruxolitinib MTD in combination with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) weekly is determined by the number of patients who have dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. In patients for whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary evaluation has been completed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection.)	Irradiation of regional lymph nodes is optional, but plans for radiation therapy must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes.

Patients with these conditions are considered ineligible unless there is biopsy evidence that these are not involved with tumor.	Prior history of breast cancer, including DCIS (patients with a history of LCIS are eligible).	Treatment, including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to randomization. One exception is hormonal therapy, which may have been given for up to a total of 28 days anytime after diagnosis and before study entry. In such a case, hormonal therapy must stop at or before randomization and be re-started, if indicated, following chemotherapy. A second exception is radiation therapy for patients enrolled in NSABP B-39 and assigned to partial breast irradiation (Group 2). These patients may have received RT prior to B-38 study entry.	Prior therapy with anthracyclines or taxanes for any malignancy.	Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to randomization.)

Concurrent treatment with other investigational agents for the treatment of breast cancer.	Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.	Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery	For patients treated by lumpectomy, whole breast irradiation is required.	The following patients will be ineligible:	Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) treated with lumpectomy. (These patients are eligible if they undergo mastectomy.)

All of the following staging criteria must be met:	By clinical and pathologic evaluation, primary tumor must be T1-3;	By clinical evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be cN0, cN1, or cN2a;	By pathologic evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be pN1 (pN1mi, pN1a, pN1b, pN1c), pN2a, pN3a, or pN3b (only if due to microscopic involvement of internal mammary node detected by sentinel lymph node dissection and with more than 3 positive axillary lymph nodes).	Patients must have an estrogen receptor (ER) analysis performed on the primary tumor prior to randomization. If ER analysis is negative, then progesterone receptor (PgR) analysis must be performed. If ER analysis is positive, PgR analysis is desired, but not mandatory.

The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. In patients for whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary evaluation has been completed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection.)	Irradiation of regional lymph nodes is optional, but plans for radiation therapy must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes.

In such a case, hormonal therapy must stop at or before randomization and be re-started, if indicated, following chemotherapy. A second exception is radiation therapy for patients enrolled in NSABP B-39 and assigned to partial breast irradiation (Group 2). These patients may have received RT prior to B-38 study entry.

Concurrent treatment with other investigational agents for the treatment of breast cancer.	Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.	Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery	For patients treated by lumpectomy, whole breast irradiation is required.	The following patients will be ineligible:	Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) treated with lumpectomy. (These patients are eligible if they undergo mastectomy.)
