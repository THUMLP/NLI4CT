The MTD is identified as the level BELOW the cohort where DLT occurred in less than one third of patients within the cohort.	If no DLT's are observed, the MTD is not reached.	Time frame: Participants were assessed prior to each dose of paclitaxel with ruxolitinib; The observation period for MTD evaluation was the first 2 cycles of treatment. (Up to 8 weeks).

secondary trial Outcome Measurement:	Maximum Tolerated Dose Determined by Dose-limiting Toxicities	1st 3 pts will be treated on arm 2. If 0/3 DLTs observed, the dose will be escalated to arm 3. If 1/3 DLTs onserved on arm 2, 3 more pts will be treated on arm 2. If no additional DLTs are observed on arm 2, the dose will be escalated to arm 3. If at most 1/6 DLTs observed on arm 3, arm 3 will be considered the MTD. If more than 1/6 DLTs observed on arm 3, the dose will be de-escalated to arm 2. If at most 1/6 DLTs observed on arm 2, arm 2 will be considered the MTD. If more than 1/6 pts on arm 2 experience a DLT, the dose will be de-escalated to arm 1. The remaining pts will be treated on arm 1 as the MTD, unless more than 1/6 DLTs, in which case the study will stop. DLT is defined as any grade III or IV non-hematologic toxicity (incl. diarrhea w\ adequate antidiarrheal treatment & hydration & nausea/vomiting w\ maximal antiemetic prophylaxis, as per protocol) or grade IV hematologic toxicity.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Ruxolitinib Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) [Phase I]	Ruxolitinib MTD in combination with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) weekly is determined by the number of patients who have dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. In patients for whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary evaluation has been completed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection.)

Concurrent treatment with other investigational agents for the treatment of breast cancer.	Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.	Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery	For patients treated by lumpectomy, whole breast irradiation is required.	The following patients will be ineligible:	Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) treated with lumpectomy. (These patients are eligible if they undergo mastectomy.)

The tumor must be invasive carcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.	All of the following staging criteria must be met:	By clinical and pathologic evaluation, primary tumor must be T1-3;	By clinical evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be cN0, cN1, or cN2a;	By pathologic evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be pN1 (pN1mi, pN1a, pN1b, pN1c), pN2a, pN3a, or pN3b (only if due to microscopic involvement of internal mammary node detected by sentinel lymph node dissection and with more than 3 positive axillary lymph nodes).	Patients must have an estrogen receptor (ER) analysis performed on the primary tumor prior to randomization. If ER analysis is negative, then progesterone receptor (PgR) analysis must be performed. If ER analysis is positive, PgR analysis is desired, but not mandatory.

Patients must have had either a lumpectomy or a total mastectomy. Patients must have completed one of the following procedures for evaluation of pathologic nodal status.	Sentinel lymphadenectomy followed by removal of additional non-sentinel lymph nodes (This approach is strongly recommended.)	Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone if one of the following criteria is met:	Pathologic nodal staging based on sentinel lymphadenectomy is pN1mi or pN1b	Surgeon elects not to remove additional non-sentinel nodes (This approach is strongly discouraged, but will not preclude participation in B-38.)

The following criteria for postoperative evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:	total bilirubin must be less than or equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome due to slow conjugation of bilirubin; and	alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and	the AST must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab; and	alkaline phosphatase and AST cannot both be greater than ULN.	Postoperative serum creatinine must be less than or equal to ULN.	At the time of randomization, the patient must have had the following: history and physical exam, EKG, and imaging of the chest within the past 3 months and bilateral mammogram within the past 6 months.

However, at the investigator's discretion, patients treated with lumpectomy for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm are eligible if eligibility criteria for lumpectomy are met.	The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. In patients for whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary evaluation has been completed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection.)	Irradiation of regional lymph nodes is optional, but plans for radiation therapy must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes.	Special conditions for eligibility of mastectomy patients: radiation therapy o Postmastectomy chest wall and/or regional nodal irradiation is optional. Plans for radiation in mastectomy patients must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes.	Ineligibility Criteria	Male patients are not eligible for this study.

Concurrent treatment with other investigational agents for the treatment of breast cancer.	Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.	Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery	For patients treated by lumpectomy, whole breast irradiation is required.	The following patients will be ineligible:	Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) treated with lumpectomy. (These patients are eligible if they undergo mastectomy.)
