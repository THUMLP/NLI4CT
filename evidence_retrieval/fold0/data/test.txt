Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient prior to the performance of any protocol-specific procedure.	The patient is diagnosed with confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease.	Note: If the metastatic disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology or histology.	The patient has documented disease progression or relapse following at least one prior standard therapy with trastuzumab (alone or in combination with chemotherapy).	Patients with prior lapatinib use are eligible. Furthermore,	The administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) should have been stopped for at least 28 days by the time of the first ASCI administration.	The administration of trastuzumab alone could be maintained after chemotherapy, but the last dose of trastuzumab should not have been given less than three weeks before the first ASCI administration.	The patient will not be given trastuzumab during the trial.	For metastatic patients whose disease is ER+ and/or PR+ the following criteria should be met:	Patients with visceral disease that requires chemotherapy (eg., patients with liver or lung metastases).	Rapidly progressing or life threatening disease, as determined by the investigator.	Patients who received hormonal therapy and are no longer benefiting from this therapy.	A tumor lesion from the patient biopsied before or during screening shows either:	Overexpression of the HER2 protein, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC, with result IHC 3+) or	Amplification of the HER2 gene as determined by FISH (at least 4 fold i.e. at least 8 copies).	Note: Overexpression/amplification measurements must be performed on a metastatic lesion in all cases where such a lesion is sufficiently easily accessible. If however such a biopsy is not possible, then these measurements can be performed on the primary tumor. Use of the primary tumor is to be documented and justified.	Ten FFPE tissue sections of the tumor on which the HER2 overexpression/amplification has been done -if available-may be requested. These may be used to retrospectively carry out part of the translational research (i.e. analysis of EGF receptor activity and of the presence of immune effector cells, refer to Section 7).

For azoospermia, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/ designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records.	Post-menopause: Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation of menstrual cycles, menses, and implies the loss of reproductive potential by ovarian failure. A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate clinical profile at the appropriate age e.g. > 45 years.	Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Progression Free Survival (PFS)	To determine whether MM-121 + exemestane was more effective than placebo + exemestane in prolonging progression-free survival. PFS was a time to event measure, and progression of disease is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), "as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions". Progression free survival was defined as the number of months from the date of randomization to the date of death or progression. If neither death nor progression was observed during the study, PFS data was censored at the last non-progressive disease valid tumor assessment unless the patient was discontinued due to symptomatic deterioration. If this occurred, the patient was counted as having progressive disease (PD).

primary trial Outcome Measurement:	Number of Participants With Progression Free Survival (PFS)	Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) must have exhibited a reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study accompanied by an absolute increase of at least 5 mm or appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference smallest sum diameters. PFS is time from enrollment to date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause.

primary trial Inclusion Criteria:	The following criteria are to be checked at the time of study entry. The patients may only be included in the study if ALL of the following statements are FULLFILLED:	The patient (male or female) is at least 18 years old at the time of signature of the informed consent form.	Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient prior to the performance of any protocol-specific procedure.	The patient is diagnosed with confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease.	Note: If the metastatic disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology or histology.	The patient has documented disease progression or relapse following at least one prior standard therapy with trastuzumab (alone or in combination with chemotherapy).	Patients with prior lapatinib use are eligible. Furthermore,	The administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) should have been stopped for at least 28 days by the time of the first ASCI administration.	The administration of trastuzumab alone could be maintained after chemotherapy, but the last dose of trastuzumab should not have been given less than three weeks before the first ASCI administration.	The patient will not be given trastuzumab during the trial.	For metastatic patients whose disease is ER+ and/or PR+ the following criteria should be met:	Patients with visceral disease that requires chemotherapy (eg., patients with liver or lung metastases).	Rapidly progressing or life threatening disease, as determined by the investigator.	Patients who received hormonal therapy and are no longer benefiting from this therapy.	A tumor lesion from the patient biopsied before or during screening shows either:	Overexpression of the HER2 protein, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC, with result IHC 3+) or	Amplification of the HER2 gene as determined by FISH (at least 4 fold i.e. at least 8 copies).	Note: Overexpression/amplification measurements must be performed on a metastatic lesion in all cases where such a lesion is sufficiently easily accessible. If however such a biopsy is not possible, then these measurements can be performed on the primary tumor. Use of the primary tumor is to be documented and justified.	Ten FFPE tissue sections of the tumor on which the HER2 overexpression/amplification has been done -if available-may be requested. These may be used to retrospectively carry out part of the translational research (i.e. analysis of EGF receptor activity and of the presence of immune effector cells, refer to Section 7).	The patient has at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria.	The patient has ECOG status of 0 or 1.	The patient has adequate bone marrow reserve as indicated by:	White blood cell count >/= 3,000/mm3.	Neutrophil count >/= 1,500/mm3.	Platelet count >/= 100,000/mm3.	Hemoglobin levels >/= 10.0 g/dl.	The patient has adequate renal function as shown by the creatinine levels (i.e. within the normal range).	The patient has adequate hepatic function as shown by serum bilirubin levels i.e:	Serum bilirubin levels within the normal limits.	Both AST and ALT levels <1.5 times the ULN. Note: However, for patients with liver metastasis, a serum bilirubin level <1.5 times the ULN and both AST and ALT levels <3 times the ULN will be accepted.	The patient has a baseline Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) measured by MUGA scan equal to or greater than the LLN for the radiology facility.	If the patient is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e. have a current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or be post-menopausal, or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to treatment, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for two months after completion of the study treatment.	Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive method with failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (when applicable, as mentioned in the product label) for example abstinence, combined or progestogen oral contraceptives, injectable progestogen, implants of levonorgestrel, oestrogenic vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches or intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), vasectomy with documented azoospermia of the sole male partner or double barrier method (condom or occlusive cap plus spermicidal agent).	For azoospermia, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/ designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records.	Post-menopause: Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation of menstrual cycles, menses, and implies the loss of reproductive potential by ovarian failure. A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate clinical profile at the appropriate age e.g. > 45 years.	Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

secondary trial Outcome Measurement:	Progression-Free Survival (PFS): Independent Radiological Facility (IRF) Assessment	IRF assessed PFS was defined as time (in months) from randomization until the date of first documented radiologic progressive disease per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. As per RECIST v1.1, progression defined as 1) for target lesions: at least a 20% increase in the sum of target lesion measurements, compared to the smallest sum on study (including baseline), the absolute increase in the sum has to be at least 5 millimeter (mm); 2) for non-target lesions: unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, evaluated as a whole, such that it is clear that treatment has failed and disease is progressing, regardless of the status of the target lesions; 3) and/or appearance of one or more new lesions. The analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.	Time frame: Baseline until radiologic progressive disease or death due to any cause (up to maximum duration of 36.9 months)	Results 1:	Arm/Group Title: Talazoparib	Arm/Group Description: Participants received talazoparib 1 mg, orally, once daily until radiographic disease progression as determined by the central IRF, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, physician's decision to terminate treatment, or sponsor's decision to terminate the trial (up to a maximum of 70.2 months). One cycle was of 21 days.	Overall Number of Participants Analyzed: 287	Median (95% Confidence Interval)	Unit of Measure: months  8.6        (7.2 to 9.3)	Results 2:	Arm/Group Title: Physician's Choice Treatment	Arm/Group Description: Participants received 1 of the following drugs in specified regimens, as per the physician's choice: 1) capecitabine 1250 mg/m^2 orally twice daily on Day 1 to 14 in each cycle; 2) eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m^2 (equivalent to eribulin 1.23 mg/ m^2), as 2 to 5 minute IV infusion on Day 1 and 8 in each cycle; 3) gemcitabine 1250 mg/m^2 as 30-minute IV infusion on Day 1 and 8 in each cycle; 4) vinorelbine 30 mg/m^2 as 6 to 10 minute IV infusion on Day 1, 8, and 15 in each cycle; until radiographic disease progression as determined by the central IRF, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, physician's decision to terminate treatment, or Sponsor's decision to terminate the trial (up to a maximum of 45.3 months). One cycle was of 21 days.	Overall Number of Participants Analyzed: 144	Median (95% Confidence Interval)	Unit of Measure: months  5.6        (4.2 to 6.7)	More than half the participants of the primary trial are considered to be censored. the secondary trial used the same outcome measurement, but had no censored patients.
